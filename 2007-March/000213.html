I don't think this attitude is helpful. what's the sense
of this? AFAICS `ion3' is a very useful WM, i.e. a tool (repeat together: A TOOL). 
as far as I understand the ion home page the whole point was to create a better
user (repeat: USER) interface. 
not for everyone, certainly, but for a non-negligible fraction of the
people who need a WM (i.e. those who are sitting in front of some unix box).

arguing against distros and/or package management systems seems bizarre to me.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;distros support their own lusers.)
</I>
maybe neither wise to interfere nor of relevance to you but anyway:

sure, you are not overreacting a bit? having strong opinions I like and getting
angry at stupidity (or what one thinks is stupidity -- not necessary the same
thing) I understand (happens to me, too), but
a 'take no prisoners' approach is too much for me. whatever and whoever might
have got on your nerves: a 12 weeks old version is &quot;ancient&quot;?  if that version
is broken, that's bad and it should not be in the distro (and maybe no
longer at the homepage for download?) but than I would argue
that it might have been better in the first place to do the usual thing and
to clearly identify/discriminate a &quot;stable version&quot; (which should
go in the distros and &quot;development snapshots&quot; (which everyone might download
from the home page and compile/test). as far as I can see, `ion3' is simply
flagged as &quot;development&quot; at the home page. so what is a poor guy wanting to
include `ion3' in a distro to do? what would have prevented to identify some
intermediate version as &quot;sufficiently stable&quot; for average use?  sure, it's not
your responsibility to do this and it's not your problem if the debian/gentoo
people have somehow managed to include the wrong `ion3' version, but sweeping
the shotgun in a 360 deg. circle in this way??

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I'm also considering extending the license (LGPL) with a &quot;Distributor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;timely response clause&quot;, something like the following (D). It could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;make Ion &quot;non-free&quot;, but I don't care about these idealists' definitions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;of freeness.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  D. Anyone distributing Ion3 in aggregate with other works, must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     within twenty-eight (28) days from the release of a new version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     of Ion3, either (A) upgrade the aggregate to include the new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     version, and cause the new version be installed when a user tries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     to install an unspecified version of Ion3, or upgrade Ion3 (from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     aggregate); or (B) remove Ion3 from the aggregate, and notify users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     of the removal, when they try to upgrade the aggregate or Ion3 (from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     the aggregate) and have installed an old version of Ion3. (It is,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     however, not necessary to remove Ion3 from the user's computer;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     merely notify of its out-datedness.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     The requirements above on responses to user actions do not apply,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     if the user is not network-connected, or chooses not to use network
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     installation, and is using physical distribution media.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     This clause does not bind any rebranded derivative works, that can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     not be confused with Ion3: that is, any derivative work whose name
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     can not be confused with &quot;Ion3&quot;, and which in in no way points
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     to the original work or its authors for support, may be distributed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     under the LGPL or GPL without this clause.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>
or maybe forbid the use of `ion3' altogether? come on. tell you what: I'm
writing this while running ion3ds-20060524 which happens to lie around at the macports
site because some nice guy added it to that package management system.
suits me fine. if I'm not content, sure I can download the official tarball and
see whether I get it installed. fact is: I have work to do and the trade off
between having the latest&amp;greatest and simply use what's there is easy for me at
the moment. you want to force the guys to upgrade their system every few weeks
or remove `ion3' altogether?  mmh. could serve as a strategy to ensure that ion
users know each other personally in a few years.

a happy not-even-having-compiled-it-himself-prehistoric-version-of-ion3-user

&gt;<i> &gt;(Perhaps this should be combined with a clause that forbids 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;distributors from applying unsupported/unapproved patches... 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;like Xft... Too bad that due to the nature of Gentoo ebuilds, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;it probably doesn't work against them.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Too bad that Ion3 is going into a freeze too soon, so that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;benefit of the clause would be minimal, as it doesn't work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;retroactively. But if that wasn't the case, I'd certainly add it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I'm sick of sloppy distributors and mega-frozen distributions, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and the lusers who think they're using the latest version because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;of them.
