What is a 'regular configuration file'? INI syntax? resolv.conf syntax?
xorg.conf syntax? xml? What 'standard' configuration files do users deal
with at this point? (Or really ever?)

And I should point out that lua can handle 'standard':

    variable = value
    variable = value

syntax just fine. So you wouldn't even need to know it was lua in the simple case.

&gt;<i> ER&gt; Actually this doesn't need to touch Tuomo at all it can be entirely with a

</I>&gt;<i> So I'd rather write something Tuomo will include in Ion3.  If you

</I>
I think you seriously overestimate the appeal of something like ion3 with
the sort of people who would need such a simplified config file syntax.

And I might very well consider attempting a simplified syntax parsing
script. Though seeing as how I have been comfortably using the lua
configuration stuff for a long time now I am not at all sure I am going to
be able to come up with useful 'names' for things people want to do.
