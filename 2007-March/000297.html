It is very much harder: just look at the example you posted. Do you consider
that readable? Aside from the command names being totally unintelligible
pairs of characters, even the flow breaks all the time with the commands
starting a new line.

&gt;<i> looking at the documentation as a prerequisite of generating a

</I>
A sensible LaTeX document can be edited to a large extend without
knowing any LaTeX, by aping what is there already, as it is quite
intelligible. Not so with *roff. 

&gt;<i> concerning &quot;understanding&quot; the latex source: I will give you that latex markup

It's not that verbose: You don't write the longer commands that often,
paragraph separation is an empty line, etc. You also don't have to
break the flow all the time unlike with *roff. (Yeah, there's also 
some inline syntax at least in -man, but it's quite awful HT/XML-like 
begin/end tag stuff.)

Anyway, the original idea indeed was that of an _interactive_ tutorial.
