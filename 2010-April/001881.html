well, yes, some of these of names do suffer from what you're describing
here (i.e. ion-ng), but i don't think names like &quot;notion&quot; or &quot;neon&quot; can
be mistaken for a trademark infringement (both are common nouns in the
english language, which is not associated with ion(tm))

</I>&gt;<i> TinyParticle? TilingMadeSimple? Quirk? (Told you I was terrible.)
</I>
yes, you are :)

&gt;<i> Tumov, I just wanted to express my heartfelt thanks for creating ion3

</I>&gt;<i> I don't plan on stopping anyttime soon.

seconded (except for the &quot;3 years&quot; part, more like 3 months for me..)

regards,
M Rawash
