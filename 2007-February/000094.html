<PRE>(Perhaps it would be better to take the part of this thread not directly
related to Xinerama off-list. Some people may be getting annoyed. But,
whatever: I don't particularly like on-topic police myself, due to crappy
technologies. Mailing lists suck, as there's no simple light-weight way to
redirect discussions elsewhere, as in Usenet. But Usenet/NNTP is also too
clumsy too with its rigid or spammed hierarchies.)

&quot;old&quot;? Doesn't sound old at all. My AthlonXP 2500+ (from mid-2003, IIRC) 
doesn't even have that frequency control shit yet, and I don't consider
it old. It only supports whatever athcool turns on (it doesn't actively
control anything). (My older Duron 1GHz would, indeed, be quite sufficient
for my needs, but its mobo leaked the juices out of its capacitors only
after a year, without showing any signs until later, and so I had to get
new mobo/cpu/memory, as finding out the broken one of them would've 
been too laboursome.)

&gt;<i> And I think the main goal on using GNU/Linux is about pushing out the

</I>
Doesn't seem like people are doing that. No, they're getting bigger
penis enlargements instead of...

&gt;<i> Multihead:

</I>&gt;<i> [...] That is indeed a reductionist explanation, and the possibilities

</I>&gt;<i> the interaction and expressiveness.
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------------
</I>
... doing more with less. That's what my multihead criticism is all about:
doing more with less. Multihead is wasteful: you don't technically need it
to do what you want to do, unless penis enlargement is precisely what you
want. As for the psychological side, i.e. your need for penis enlargements,
I don't care. I just care what you purportedly need that wasteful extra
screen (or other gizmo) for, and whether you technically really need it for
that. I can be the judge of technical need if you provide the necessary
information, and most of the time, there is not one, because people don't
dare to say that it's penis enlargement precisely, what they want.

You know, you probably could survive without that computer too. You 
don't need it to survive. But you need it for many other things, that
I can agree with. And a screen too. But you don't need multiple screens,
or a really big screen to do these things, just a modest-sized screen.
You also shouldn't need a very powerful computer, and certainly not
an x86 frying pan, but unfortunately these things are a bit out of
any single person's control... 

(There are processors that demand far less energy for the same computing
power as the x86 mount de manure, although their peak power may not be as
high. But by using multiple low-power processors (or multicore) in parallel,
you could get a lot of computing... That's where I think things will
eventually head, if people get into their senses: many low-power 
computing units instead of a single centralised frying pan.)

As you can see, it's all about doing more with less, and multihead is
antithetic to that for most uses. As for a penis enlargement, well,
rather a screen than a car, if people would just admit that's what they
want it for. But better without either. (An urban automobile is like a
penis with AIDS and pus, and an SUV the over-bloated same. Now, a
train/metro/etc., that's a decent-sized healthy penis... and far more
energy-efficient than that gas-guzzling murderous tin can.)

&gt;<i> but dividing the screen by two in 17&quot; monitors perhaps is not good
</I>&gt;<i> enough.
</I>
It is. That's all I've ever had, and works great. For programming, for
latex+pdf/dvi, for everything I've ever had to do. At least with Ion. And
if you're using something worse, well, you could do more with less by
switching to Ion. Or creating something even better. Of course you might
be doing something that I don't do, that really does demand more screen
space even in my opinion, but those handful of people most certainly
people do not include techno-toy fetists bragging about their zillion
monitor configurations, and crying after broken Xinerama support in Ion.

&gt;<i> Finally, I am just thinking about the technical possibility of making
</I>&gt;<i> work Ion with some Xinerama alternative, perhaps MergedFB on ati
</I>&gt;<i> devices. Maybe repeating somebody in the list, would be possible to
</I>&gt;<i> point in that direction considering there are not much documentation
</I>&gt;<i> about?
</I>
As far as I'm concerned, Xinerama is a protocol, for communicating
geometries of physical screens on the root window, not a particular X
server module. NVidias drivers also don't use the standard modules, but
they use the same protocol: hence they provide Xinerama. The case is
likely to be the same with ATIs. As far as applications are concerned,
it's Xinerama.

X has supported non-Xinerama multihead for ages, however..
