Really - You think that's good?
I really do question your sanity at times, more recently than ever before.  
You have written, and published, a pretty decent WM, but don't seem to  
want anyone to benefit from it.

Simply adding the message you want to the top of the ion man page, and  
that &quot;informational&quot; window that you get first time you run ion really  
ought to be enough to say &quot;this package may not be the latest available -  
check tuomo's site&quot;. TBH - I'd not care if that popped up every time I ran  
ion (once every 6 months or so, whenever I have a power cut).


&gt;&gt;<i> I  think  it really would be a wise and nice thing to do and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> draw a line at demanding some unambigous info in the package
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that  it's none of your buiseness if an old version does not

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This distros are mostly composed of ridiculuous fuckwits and
</I>&gt;<i> dickheads -- ex school bullies who can only package and corrupt
</I>&gt;<i> others' software -- if even that -- and not actually write new
</I>&gt;<i> software, let alone something that wouldn't be a clone (the whole
</I>&gt;<i> FOSS movement is incapable of that). They consider it &quot;unreasonable&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and impossible to add prominent notices that I will have nothing
</I>&gt;<i> to do with their obsolete and modified shit. Renaming is the
</I>&gt;<i> alternative to that.
</I>
So anyone who doesn't spend all their time recompiling software for what  
is, for most people, a tool and nothing more, is an idiot according to you.
Well, I almost exclusively use binary packages - because they make my life  
easier.  And yes I expect them ALL to behave the same way. If you're  
writing a distro then that level of consistency in your package management  
is important. Adding prominent messages to ion (the program, not a special  
case in the package handler) is much easier.  People who hate it strongly  
enough can simply compile it out if they want (or you could add a config  
option) - package maintainers won't bother.

&gt;&gt;<i> otherwise  this  seems  a sure strategy to finish `ion3' off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outside of a _very_ small group. I'm sure you would'nt  care
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but need you enforce such a thing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to have anything to do with the typical specimen of
</I>&gt;<i> the FOSS herd. I rather deal with a handful of nice and intelligent
</I>&gt;<i> people.
</I>
You'd rather deal with yourself and only yourself - you've demonstrated  
this arrogance before, and will do again.  It's a shame that I don't have  
the time to write a tiling WM myself, because I actually think that a  
couple of us here could do a very good job of it.
