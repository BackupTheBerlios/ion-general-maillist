It is. Most importantly, there's a race condition: if the flash 
window doesn't get the focus fast enough, when it goes into FS 
mode, it will close. But this &quot;trying to outsmart the WM&quot; also
means you can't open the scratchpad while flash is FS, can't
switch back to another WS while flash is FS, or the window will
un-FS.

&gt;<i> I wouldn't like the ugly Flash ads on a web-page to make itself

This &quot;feature&quot; won't stop that, if the flash crap can avoid the
above-mentioned race condition.

&gt;<i> Flash is made for dummies.
</I>
All Web technology invented after HTML 2.0, with the exception
of CSS, is for dummies. 

(And even CSS is too complicated.  I suspect it could be 
simplified a lot, if would only have to cater to document 
layout, not application layout. And applications would benefit
from something not suited to documents. *sigh* again trying
to do everything with one language.)

There's a problem? It should not be set, and there's a school of
thought that thinks this is how it should be. I have no particular
opinion (!) about the matter, but tend to slightly side with not
setting it. I just wish MUAs were more intelligent about List-Post
and headers. Even mutt -- the mail user agent that sucks the least
-- is stupid with regard to mailing lists. It sucks having to
configure the lists in .procmailrc, include a subscribe line in
.muttrc, include a mailbox line in .muttrc for checking for new
mail (or alternatively, if not procmailed into separate folders, 
write save-hooks), and then remember to press L instead of r
to reply. The default reply key should ask what to do when there
are multiple options (list, group, or just the poster, etc.).
Setting Reply-To is a workaround to retarded MUAs. 

I just use slrn and <A HREF="nntp://news.gmane.org">nntp://news.gmane.org</A> whenever possible.
