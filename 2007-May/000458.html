</I>Note, that I'm not trying to talk you into merging autoconf scripts
back, all I was saying is that the fact that you're uncomfortable with
something doesn't make it suck or &quot;a fucked up mess&quot;. Statements that
you make here are solely based upon your feelings and you try to use
as if they were objectively correct which is often not the case.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Luac produces architecture dependent code.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So what is fucked up then?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, gcc is fucked up too then.
</I>With regards to cross compilation capability it obviously is not.

&gt;<i> &gt; How do you tell an enlarged one from a naturally big one?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The show-off.
</I>So you don't believe in natural ones at all?

&gt;<i> &gt; The point is that I did not have to look at how ion works for several
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; years now and I don't even remember what a module is in this context.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't have to look at how font systems work for several years, and
</I>&gt;<i> then they made everything use Xft and fontconfig, and now I have to
</I>&gt;<i> spend hours on it to get nice clear crisp fonts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't have to look at how device mapping works for several years,
</I>&gt;<i> and then they started the SCSI-mapping insanity and practically
</I>&gt;<i> demanding udev. Now I have to waste hours to create a fucking symlink
</I>&gt;<i> in /dev.
</I>Deep inside we're all scared and lonely and offended by those FOSS
developers doing what they please. So that's why you mistreat your
users likewise?

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Yes, and my bicycle has diamond frame. (Seriously, it has.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And owning a bike is a consumer trend there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, SUV the size of a high-rise building is the penis enlargement
</I>&gt;<i> trend over here. The bicycle is a mere transportation necessity,
</I>Those penises that can't afford this type of enlargement still often
have an urge to be enlarged somehow.

&gt;<i> assuming you agree that people need to move around faster and
</I>&gt;<i> longer distances than is practical by walking -- which isn't much
</I>Is it still practical to ride a bike below -10C in winter considering
wind and humidity?

-- 
I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me.
