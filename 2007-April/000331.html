</I>
The main advantage of dual monitor support for me is the fact that the
workspaces are independent (so I can switch workspace on monitor 1 and
monitor 2 remains the same), and that fullscreening a window makes it
fullscreen, rather than stretching across two monitors. Without those
two things, I might as well just tile such that no tile crosses between
monitors.

&gt;&gt;<i> Just for the record, I was also using ion3 until Xinerama support was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dropped. I have a TV card and like to run tvtime on the second monitor.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've switched back to ion2 for now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To be fair, Xinerama does tend to have awful support elsewhere too. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gimp really hates dual-monitor set-ups (Every time I want to use my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> graphics tablet I have to start a new display that only uses one of my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> monitors), and qiv also breaks in fullscreen mode. I'm sure there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other examples.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> agree'd. i have given up on using the gimp under ion a
</I>&gt;<i> long time ago, tho (prefer shotophop under vmware anyways).
</I>
Photoshop actually runs quite well under Wine these days, if that's
handy at all for you :)
