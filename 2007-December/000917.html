<PRE>Hi there,

guys, I don't think that this discussion will lead anywhere.
A few days ago, when ion3 was removed from the FreeBSDs ports system I
was quite angry and looking for an alternative.  There are several
tiling WMs available, but none of them is a good replacement for ion3.
So I'll stay with ion3 and continue reading this mailing list.

On the freebsd-ports mailing list I stated that I can understand some
of Tuomos opinions, and I'm ready to give more details: I started
using Linux back in the days as the 486 systems slowly where replaced
with the first generation of pentiums. Back in these days
installations where done with CDs and Diskettes were still widely in
use. Packaging was done by extracting tarballs in the root directory.
In these days people dreamed about replacing Windows. They were happy
that their Linux installation was smaller than any Windows setup.

Several years later things changed dramatically: Most Linux
installations are bigger than everything Microsoft installs. Instead
of designing something good and new people started to copy Windows
just make it more easy for non Linux-users to migrate.
You can select between Gnome, KDE and Xcfe, and all try to do the
same. Users want applications that help them solving a problem. But
now you have  KDE-App that is better than everything found in Gnome
and vice versa. So you'll end up having all Libs and dependancies
installed anyway. Great...

When someone is using an Unix for the first time he/she complains that
things are different than on Linux. I'm beyond the point to discuss
such stupidity, I just want to slap them in the face. Most people
don't even want to know why things are handled differently and just
states that &quot;Linux is better&quot; - without even knowing the technical
background of a solution.

So Linux created some kind of standard because people started to
develop _for Linux_ and not Open Source in general. This led to
strange effects where Unices are said to behave wrongly or are even
buggy due to their own implenentation of a library/function
call/whatever. Libiconv is a nice example for this.
So when you open a problem record for a tool because you've problems
on Solaris for example you find your problem being closed without
solution because the problem is the target OS. Nice.
On the other hand if there is something wrong with a program users are
being told to fix it themselves because they have the code. What a
chizophrenia! Most users aren't developers, and most developers aren't
even good at what they are doing. I wouldn't want any user with
limited coding abilities to fidle around with some source code.
But exactly those users is being told that it is save to switch over
to Linux instead of Mac OS X. Yeah, I see...

So yes, &quot;Modern technology mostly sucks.&quot; puts it in good terms. This
is correct for most Hardware related things, too. Look at USB, the
protocol just sucks because of it's overhead. But you find it
everywhere.

I dropped Linux two years ago after many annoyances with the kernel
and related software. If you're not on the mainstream road but like
something else (PowerPC, for example), you're doomed. Patches are
blocked upstream or even removed after it's clear they break something
x86-related. Which is just possible because something is broken in x86
anway. But instead of fixing the x86 parts the PowerPC patches were
removed. Great...
BTW: Linus Torvalds said a few month ago that Linux drivers are
working &quot;good enough&quot;. What the hell does this mean? It means in the
end that these drivers don't work in 100% of all possible
configurations. And this means that some users have to play with
something else.

This had side effects on all distributions, of course. If you want to
make it easy for all users to work with Linux, you have to take
everything into account. So it doesn't matter if a workstation needs
20 seconds to boot up, or 120.

Package maintainers have to deal with every single of these issues.
They have to take care of dependencies, versions and stuff. This is
why I have some sympathy with them and wouldn't label them as
&quot;dickheads&quot;. I'm happy when I've a package at hand that I can use. The
FreeBSD ports system was exactly what I was looking for. I dropped
Debian because of issues with their ports system, and Gentoos emerge
was just too slow, and fiddling around with masked packages is awfull.
I guess that every package systems has its pros and cons, because it
has to be compromise between the package and the distribution. You
can't just include every newest version of a piece of software as long
as you don't know the consequences. On the other hand some packages
have too many changes/patches applied (found this on Debian where
several packages have nothing in common with the default).

Yes, there is a &quot;FOSS herd&quot;, and most of the time it makes me want to
cry. For me switching over to Windows is not an option, most windows
users are even less educated than OSS users.

BTW: Some people state that AntiAliasing is bad for the eyes since the
font appears to be blurred it's stressfull to look at since the eyes
try to get it properly focused. At least it adds up to the fact why
eyes are getting tired infront of the screen...
