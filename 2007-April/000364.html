<PRE>Quick questions (I don't want to start a thread about another WM on the  
Ion list):

o Does it have tabs, or just rearrange tiled windows like dwm?
o If tabs, nested tabs?
o Ion-like arbitrary tiled client shape/relative position?
(This last one is a reference to a &quot;feature&quot; of wmii. Most people at the  
university I'm at used Ion for some time, but migrated to wmii in the last  
six months to a year. I've tried it but dislike it because the menu tab  
complets, but does not let you tab through things, there aren't any real  
tabs (tabs stack, and therefore take an irritating amount of screen  
space), and, if it's possible, nobody knows how to have windows of varying  
widths over each other (say, three panes, two in the bottom half of the  
screen, one spanning them both on top.)
o Does it have some kind of scripting support? Is this in Haskell, some  
shell language, or something more godforsaken?
o Support for floating windows?
o Is it possible to kill windows that don't supply their own quit button  
in a sane way (not the MOD+Shift+C of wmii; I don't even know if dwm can  
do that)?
o Does it have a run dialog of any kind?

I'm assuming it employs dwm's tagged workspace model, which is its most  
interesting and useful feature. Any variations on this would be  
interesting. -POLM
