.. by turning it all slow by constant swapping. Seriously, all apps
initially drawing into backbuffers is an absurd and unnecessary waste
of memory (and natural resources). It may not show when you run a single
program with one big window along with a few auxiliary windows, which is
most the WIMP interface can really handle. But Ion you typically have 
dozens of windows open. Now consider all of them having a backbuffer 
constantly allocated. Is there any way to turn it off (discarding drawing
requests as normal) for (invisible) windows, when not needed? I haven't
studied the protocols in detail. 

I do, however, think that in general a proxy program (compositing manager) 
copying damaged regions is a wasteful na&#239;ve/ad hoc approach plagued various
problems, such as memory waste and programs needing speedy redraws
(requiring lots of communication and multiple context switches between
the original program, X, and the compositing manager, unless the program
is set to bypass the compositing manager). An approach reminiscent of pixel
and vertex shader programs would probably be better. Instead of uploading
shaders to a graphics card, you'd upload a transformation program on the X 
server, in a non-Turing complete language with guaranteed time bounds.
(Of course that program might also specify shaders.) You might then also
support general drawing programs, being able to just upload widget drawing
programs and stuff, instead of sending all the commands over the socket
each time, improving performance over slow networks.

In any case, if someone wants to write a compositing manager, please go
ahead. I don't think I'll ever find the time; I rather spend what time
I find on more &quot;fundamental&quot; ideas... that might be improved by a CM.
