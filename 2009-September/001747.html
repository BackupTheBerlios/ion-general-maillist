Well I think you decision is already take so I'm not going argue with you.
Just little information : As I understand Tuomo Valkonen as stop the
developement of this software. Here is what he say :

 &#171;I have recently given up on the failure known as Linux, and switched to
 Windows. As I thus probably won't be working much on Ion3 anymore, and
 since it seems very stable anyway, the 28-day clause in the license should
 serve little practical purpose anymore. It has therefore been lifted.&#187;

Anyway if you don't want that ports I can understand easily why. That make
me sad, but thanks to Dmitry I can use ion-3  and because ion-3 not
going to evolve I'm going to keep that &#171;pseudo-ports&#187; in some &#171;safe&#187;-place.

Regards.
