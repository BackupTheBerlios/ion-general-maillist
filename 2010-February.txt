Subject: mouse jumping to first tab
Message-ID: <1265840461.13010.13.camel@localhost>

hi, i make use of nested (WTiling) workspaces alot, but whenever i
switch to a workspace using the mouse (either by clicking or using the
mousewheel) the cursor jumps to the first 'tab' in that workspace, this
is extremely annoying (especially in the mouseweel case), how do i stop
this behaviour?

thank you,
M Rawash

Try changing the
    mclick("Button1 at tab", "WFrame.p_switch_tab(_)")
to
    mclick("Button1 at tab", "ioncore.set({warp=false} WFrame.p_switch_tab(_) ioncore.set({warp=true}")

know that is what it meant (guess i should have RTFM), thank you :)
