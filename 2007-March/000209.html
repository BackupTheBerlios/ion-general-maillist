<PRE>As everyone knows, real Ion users compile from source ;-)  If you need a distro 
to manage Ion installation, maybe you should consider some other WM...?

BTW thanks for a great window manager.  Now I'm ruined forever; all the other 
WMs have so much eye candy I feel like I'm going to go into insulin shock 
whenever I try them.

</I>&gt;<i> anyone who has not installed Ion from the official tarball. Let the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also considering extending the license (LGPL) with a &quot;Distributor

</I>&gt;<i> make Ion &quot;non-free&quot;, but I don't care about these idealists' definitions
</I>&gt;<i> of freeness.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   D. Anyone distributing Ion3 in aggregate with other works, must
</I>&gt;<i>      within twenty-eight (28) days from the release of a new version
</I>&gt;<i>      of Ion3, either (A) upgrade the aggregate to include the new
</I>&gt;<i>      version, and cause the new version be installed when a user tries
</I>&gt;<i>      to install an unspecified version of Ion3, or upgrade Ion3 (from the
</I>&gt;<i>      aggregate); or (B) remove Ion3 from the aggregate, and notify users
</I>&gt;<i>      of the removal, when they try to upgrade the aggregate or Ion3 (from
</I>&gt;<i>      the aggregate) and have installed an old version of Ion3. (It is,
</I>&gt;<i>      however, not necessary to remove Ion3 from the user's computer;
</I>&gt;<i>      merely notify of its out-datedness.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      The requirements above on responses to user actions do not apply,
</I>&gt;<i>      if the user is not network-connected, or chooses not to use network
</I>&gt;<i>      installation, and is using physical distribution media.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      This clause does not bind any rebranded derivative works, that can
</I>&gt;<i>      not be confused with Ion3: that is, any derivative work whose name
</I>&gt;<i>      can not be confused with &quot;Ion3&quot;, and which in in no way points
</I>&gt;<i>      to the original work or its authors for support, may be distributed
</I>&gt;<i>      under the LGPL or GPL without this clause.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Perhaps this should be combined with a clause that forbids 
</I>&gt;<i> distributors from applying unsupported/unapproved patches... 
</I>&gt;<i> like Xft... Too bad that due to the nature of Gentoo ebuilds, 
</I>&gt;<i> it probably doesn't work against them.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Too bad that Ion3 is going into a freeze too soon, so that the
</I>&gt;<i> benefit of the clause would be minimal, as it doesn't work
</I>&gt;<i> retroactively. But if that wasn't the case, I'd certainly add it.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sick of sloppy distributors and mega-frozen distributions, 
</I>&gt;<i> and the lusers who think they're using the latest version because
</I>&gt;<i> of them.
