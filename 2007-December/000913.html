Seriously, the right place to put a &quot;don't cry if you aren't bleeding  
edge&quot; message is in the code - nowhere else will do the job nearly as well.

&gt;&gt;<i> No - they just wouldn't bother.  Package maintainers aren't out to screw
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you - they are out to make others lives easier
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bullshit. They e.g. include patches and modules I will not have anything
</I>&gt;<i> to do with
</I>Are you talking about Xinerama support here? - the mod which works fine,  
doesn't cause probles on non Xineramra desktops but you have some bizarre  
notion is amoral on some grounds I've never quite grasped?

&gt;&gt;<i> Most development should be cathedral style, with a bazzar as &quot;unstable&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> The distros take the bazaar unstable snapshots of software, and  
</I>&gt;<i> fraudulently provide them as &quot;stable&quot; in their megafrozen cathedrals.
</I>Not in my experience with ion on various distros, obscure bugs will always  
exist - and unless you provide stable branches what is a maintainer meant  
to to? The path of least resistance is to take the latest release and test  
it for a while, then release it if it's stable on their box(es).  As you  
don't maintain a &quot;stable&quot; branch they can't rely on you to fix a bug  
without introducing more in line with some shiny new feature that you're  
preparing for.
So the correct solution here is for you to maintain two branches - Stable  
and devel. Fix bugs in stable and make a new stable branch every so often  
when there is a feature set you're happy to release (and consider feature  
complete and stable). Then abandon the old stable.
How hard can a single integrate be when a bug is found? Then the cathedral  
engineers can be confident in what they are using, and you get a limited  
set of code to support, which was your original complaint IIRC.

&gt;&gt;<i> My work machine must &quot;just work&quot;(TM) I don't have time to fiddle with it
</I>&gt;<i> The distros don't deliver.
</I>Then try another one - I haven't had any problems recently.

&gt;<i> FOSS doesn't deliver. I don't have the time
</I>&gt;<i> to fix fonts on every upgrade, and yet FOSS keeps becoming more and more
</I>&gt;<i> AA/XML-fascist. I don't have the time for configuring udev brain damage
</I>&gt;<i> to my needs. And I don't have the time to compile software when distros
</I>&gt;<i> provide old and broken versions, instead of recent ones.
</I>I really don't know what your problem is with AA or udev: Correctly done  
AA actually helps text (although it's not always available), udev doesn't  
exactly kick up a stink.  My machine &quot;just works&quot; (TM).
I only check the version of running software when I'm looking for a  
particular feature, or about to go and search online docs / ask for advice.

&gt;&gt;<i> Yes - because &quot;The Party&quot; is the best placed to package them in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consistent manner for their users.
</I>&gt;<i> And this purported &quot;consistency&quot; comes at an expense of forming a few
</I>&gt;<i> powerful central parties that oppress authors
</I>Ah - you're feeling opressed.  Then again you seem to feel victimised by  
most walks of life if your blog is anything to go by. I think that's  
mostly how you view the world.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;I've had enough of the FOSS herd, and how it's destroying everything I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;once thought could be great. I really am universes distant from them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not really, you just regard yourself as the &quot;one true way&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> If flexible dynamically extensible and non-monoculturist software is
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;one true way&quot;, then so be it. For the FOSS herd, Party control,
</I>&gt;<i> huge monoliths, anti-aliasing, udev, UTF-8, WIMP, etc. are the one
</I>&gt;<i> true way.
</I>non-monoculturist? So you'll support xinerama, anti aliasing, udev now  
will you? Rather than declaring them all to be anti-tuomo.


&gt;&gt;<i> I'd also love to see a WM that encouragees it's users to contribute  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back,
</I>&gt;<i> Ion is modular. But the moronic FOSS herd does not like modular code:
</I>&gt;<i> it wants the original author to maintain their shoddy patches that he
</I>&gt;<i> does not care about. That is, once again they want the authors to be
</I>&gt;<i> their slave, just like the distros do.
</I>So you're unable to take a shoddy patch and apply the correct fix to your  
own code? That seems pretty feeble
