Here are some. There may be others that I can't recall right now.

  * Statusd improvements: should use a proper protocol, and support
    multiple independent daemons; perhaps one for each monitor,
    written in the author's language of choice. It really sucks
    that every clone-statusbar author duplicates the work that
    goes into writing and maintaining those monitoring
    scripts/plugins. (That's typical FOSS: lots of redundant work,
    although it's supposed to foster cooperation. But nobody ever
    bothers to write properly reusable code -- across languages --
    which I'm trying to encourage here.)

    DBus is in principle the right protocol for this, although I 
    really don't like the UTF-8 monoculturism [1] inherit in DBus and
    all the commercial-quality crap that this powerful FDO clique of
    paid developers spews out. One could also use mod_ionflux [2] 
    as a base, improving the protol slightly to be similar to the 
    present statusd protocol, and to support arbitrary commands.

  [2]: <A HREF="http://iki.fi/tuomov/ion/misc.html">http://iki.fi/tuomov/ion/misc.html</A>

  * Statusbar improvements: multi-line support, perhaps pointer
    action support for fields, etc. (If one wants
    support for the over-complex FDO systray protocol, it has to
    be a separate module. Complete support is very difficult,
    because it depends on the brain-damage known as XEmbed:
    essentially that means writing a new non-ICCCM window 
    manager with lots of ugly NIH hacks that work around using 
    proper existing solutions like XGrabKey.)

  * FDO startup notification spec [3] support could be nice. 
    If more applications supported it, it should allow for proper
    placement of windows in their startup frames. As usual, the protocol 
    is quite complex to implement support for, and should be a separate
    module (plus maybe new extra hooks, although I think I
    specifically added some already).

  [3]: <A HREF="http://standards.freedesktop.org/startup-notification-spec/startup-notification-latest.txt">http://standards.freedesktop.org/startup-notification-spec/startup-notification-latest.txt</A>

  * Much of libmainloop could be replaced by libevent [4],
    improving code reuse and taking away maintenance burden.

  [4]: <A HREF="http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/">http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/</A>

  * Further drawing engine interface abstraction (I have some more
    detailed ideas, if there's real interest).

  * Additional drawing engines, with better configurability than
    the simple default one.

  * An ELisp-style binding command system might be nice, complete with
    queries for parameters if not given, although it's extra work to 
    maintain compared to the mere Lua programming interface [5].
    But then again, menus already do contain the same definitions,
    so one could just extend the menu definitions, and use menu names
    as the commands (with translation support!), a bit like Opera has
    clear-text command names.

  * Maybe, especially in conjunction of the previous feature, the 
    config could be more tree-form, storable in arbitrary structural
    files (incl. a single Lua table). 

  * There are tonnes of minor glitches and incompleteness in Ion3.
