<PRE>Hi,

I have been using ion for 2 years, thanks for the great work :)
I must admit I recently switched to dwm, which is a really light wm.

I still use riot, waiting for any new improvements!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; snapshot that they have (20061223, the last release with totally broken
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Xinerama support) from the new static (so called &quot;stable&quot;) distribution,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will be refusing to deal with the average Debian luser, just like I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can't be bothered to deal with the average Gentoo luser. Sucks though 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that already filtering out these lusers from the complaining masses is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a lot of work. Sucks that the first question to everyone must be &quot;which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version and distro you're using&quot; -- and it's usually the people who've 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; installed Ion from a distribution, that are using old unsupported 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development snapshots. (Actually, maybe I should just stop supporting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anyone who has not installed Ion from the official tarball. Let the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distros support their own lusers.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm also considering extending the license (LGPL) with a &quot;Distributor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; timely response clause&quot;, something like the following (D). It could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make Ion &quot;non-free&quot;, but I don't care about these idealists' definitions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of freeness.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   D. Anyone distributing Ion3 in aggregate with other works, must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      within twenty-eight (28) days from the release of a new version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      of Ion3, either (A) upgrade the aggregate to include the new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      version, and cause the new version be installed when a user tries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      to install an unspecified version of Ion3, or upgrade Ion3 (from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      aggregate); or (B) remove Ion3 from the aggregate, and notify users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      of the removal, when they try to upgrade the aggregate or Ion3 (from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      the aggregate) and have installed an old version of Ion3. (It is,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      however, not necessary to remove Ion3 from the user's computer;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      merely notify of its out-datedness.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      The requirements above on responses to user actions do not apply,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      if the user is not network-connected, or chooses not to use network
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      installation, and is using physical distribution media.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      This clause does not bind any rebranded derivative works, that can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      not be confused with Ion3: that is, any derivative work whose name
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      can not be confused with &quot;Ion3&quot;, and which in in no way points
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      to the original work or its authors for support, may be distributed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      under the LGPL or GPL without this clause.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Perhaps this should be combined with a clause that forbids 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distributors from applying unsupported/unapproved patches... 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like Xft... Too bad that due to the nature of Gentoo ebuilds, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it probably doesn't work against them.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Too bad that Ion3 is going into a freeze too soon, so that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; benefit of the clause would be minimal, as it doesn't work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; retroactively. But if that wasn't the case, I'd certainly add it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm sick of sloppy distributors and mega-frozen distributions, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the lusers who think they're using the latest version because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of them.
