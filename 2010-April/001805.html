</I>Firstly, why not to fork ion3 to add needed functionality? (i do not know is there any 'no forks' etc in it's license because the ion3's page is down)
Secondly, there was some project like 'ion3 with scripts in python but without tuomo', unfortunately i can not give you it's name or link to it. It was dead when i lurked about it, but it has no licensing problems - so you can just fork it and write the code you need. 
Also, i know that xmonad or stumpwm could both be a good alternative for the static-frames-with-tabs wm behavior, first only after huge code-writing using the existing modules (XMonad.Tabs), and second pretty out-of-box - only one thing bothers me - for both of them i need to learn completely unknowm programming languages - so i'm stick with ion, too. And both of them lack for scratchpad-like function, while i'm using it.
But i do not see any argument why i should ever bother finding alternative to ion, e.g. - it has all the functions i need, out-of-the-box or with plugins, it is stable, it builds with current x-libraries, etc.
