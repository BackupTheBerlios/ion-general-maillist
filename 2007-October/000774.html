<PRE>On &quot;pantographs,&quot; continued:

I am using a Logitech V270 cordless optical mouse for bluetooth.
It weights 323 g [2x AA batteries inclusive!, thank you very
much]. A [manufacturer's description--but agreed:] 1000-dpi
optical sensor offers incredibly smooth, precise tracking for
maximum productivity while traveling [R.L.: and beyond].

The *look* is understatement for its class. Seen from the side,
the V270 has the profile of a cat who is making a hump. And
the nearly flat, tall, left and right sides of the V270 may
disappoint you at first ... in case you were expecting something
*cooler* for your eyes.

In fact, the ergonomics of the Logitech V270 is VERY well
designed.

In another post I have said I believe to have regular sized
hands. Okay, continuing: if I shape my hand like a cup, and lay
it over a desk in pronation [palm under] position, the V270 fills
PERFECTLY the hollow--provided I let the index- and the medium
fingers a bit uplifted ... perhaps like the fangs, or the first
pair of legs, of a funnel-web spider [atrax robustus].

The thumb on one side, and the annular plus the little finger
on the other one, can now SUPERBLY make grip on the--oh
wonder--flat, or nearly so, walls of the V270. While the index
and the annular rest, arranged in a comfortable V-position, over
two generously sized levers/*buttons*, with the wheel in the
middle, and thankfully not interfering ... in case one doesn't,
or can't use the wheel.

Wrist and forearm lay agreeably, if not entirely relaxed, on the
desk, virtually immobile: to let the V270 slide the mm or cm I
need [ca 1 cm to move the cursor from left to right, maybe 8 mm
from top to bottom], I merely flex, or extend, the thumb and the
little finger in general.

Voila', this ... arachnids-like arrangement of the hand--without
the cord there is also little to make the device recall a *mouse*
longer--is perhaps obeying to the .. *gradient* of the optimal
use of the V270. Which I would dare to say is a reasonably
representative contemporary *mouse*.

Kudos to Logitech.

I am using the V270 since a few months, and it is the best
*mouse* I have used ever. (I am not saying that there can't be
better mice around.)

Wirth prefers mice with three buttons. I like ones with two ...
in fact, I regard as not too challenging, from the perspective of
the *motoric* [physiology], to push two buttons contemporaneously
to emulate the third button. On the other hand, I ignore whether
an *instructions statistic*, RISC's like, has been done for the
need/use of buttons in mice: I very seldom need to emulate the
use of the third button. Moreover, I am a *fan* of the Spanish
architect Campo Baeza--a fellow from the *essentialist* movement
[those of the slogan &quot;more with less,&quot; in a humorous, more
*positive*/*active* rephrasing/pun of the &quot;less is more&quot; of the
*minimalist*].

About the weight: 323 g of the V270. You would not be able
to make a difference, it's still to little compared with the
total: weight of a loaded notebook bag with or without mouse,
even not with a V270 ... you would not manage to discover if
there is one inside the bag without looking; I guess not even
be able to discriminate *differentially*: one bag in one hand,
another one in the second. 

About the touchpad: I think that it makes sense--for *special
situations* [let's recall that a notebook is more or less
mobile]: mouse doesn't work for any reason, no space to use it,
etc. And as longer it doesn't add significantly to the cost of
the notebook.

Example: Helsinki, January, snow, night. Tuomo has just lowered
the [electric powered] window glass on his side in the car, when
he discovers that, suddenly, he can't longer lift the window
glass--for any any reasons: ice, electric motor problem, etc. A
simple winder would now be VERY welcomed.

Ditto for Roy in [fantasy selection:] Palembang. Just replace snow
with rain [when it rains heavily in Sumatra, it comes down in one
hour as much water than in two-three rainy months in Zurich].


Cheers,

/Roy
