&gt;<i> Vim's actually an excellent example of my previous point, that ease of
</I>&gt;<i> use != short learning curve. I'm pretty sure I don't know half of vim's
</I>&gt;<i> keybindings yet, but the ones I do know make it a lot easier than, say,
</I>&gt;<i> gedit. If I want to do something in vim, I'm usually quite confident that
</I>&gt;<i> that's because I don't know how to do it (and subsequently look it up)
</I>&gt;<i> rather than it lacks the feature.

I am crazy for elvis, actually. I am bit worried because elvis seems (I would
welcome to be mistaken), in the carabinieri-joke sense (see the other reply)
perhaps, unmaintained since too many years ... it can't be, real world error
less programs do not exist.

Or then, not in the way [maintained] that makes me enthusiastic really: I
have seen a GNOME patch in the news (shudder ... I am think at the Midnight
Commander). In fact, I am increasingly feeling like I would be in company of
a given Mr. Procrustes, the fellow from the bed: I suspect that I will have
to accept/envisage the idea to become *stretched* a bit up to the size of vim
(elvis is significantly slimmer: less code/bloat &lt;=&gt; less errors in general).
The alternative being: starting to maintain elvis by myself.

Anyway, while nervously browsing links on elvis, right now, I have not been
able to resist revisiting a classic link (helps keeping the morale up):

    Why, oh WHY, do those #?@! nutheads use vi?
    <A HREF="http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html">http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html</A>

Maybe this following point (Misconception #3), which is perfectly applicable to
Ion too, will find us in agreement:

    Misconception #3: you gotta be nuts and/or a genius to use it

    Well, I hope that with the above explanations and examples, you have
    already seen some of the power that vi/vim provides. Learning it is tough
    (see below), but if you're going to be editing code 8 hours or more a day
    for years, it's the second best investment after learning touch typing
    (which you already know, right? If not, don't bother with vi, learn
    that first). A learning curve of weeks make sense for such a lifetime
    investment. And, at least, you won't have a dumb assistant to annoy you to
    death.

    The point is, with vi, your keyboard becomes a huge specialized
    text-editing gamepad with almost a hundred buttons. Each of them has
    at least two functions, shifted and unshifted, so you have almost two
    hundred functions at a single keypress (not counting Shift). Commands
    are incredibly powerful for text editing, and you can even combine them
    to obtain the best results. While typing some text, it is a regular
    keyboard, but when you're back to normal mode you have the best-designed
    text-editing machine there is, and it shows.

I do not intend to start a flame war on editors otherwise. The author of the
article (and pheromone-bait resistant *insect*) ;) tells in his intro

    No, they are not dinosaurs [Roy: vi/vim users ... with reference to
    the &quot;30-years-old vi&quot;] who don't want to catch up with the times - the
    community of vi users just keeps growing: myself, I only got started
    2 years ago (after over 10 years of being a professional programmer).
    Friends of mine are converting today. Heck, most vi users were not even
    born when vi was written!

just in case.

Cheers,

/Roy Lanek

P.S.

More subtly, in linguistic, oral and written languages are regarded as
different beasts--with divergent/discrepant modalities--within every different
language. It would be nonsense to approach text in language as it would be
an oral medium (I am thinking at your &quot;intuitive&quot; referring ... perhaps; in
the sense of *more comfortable*) in general. The difficulty is insurmountable.
A summation of half-truths/things done half-way (half-way because they are
inherently limited) do not make a truth or something conclusive. One is still
left at case zero, and so till he decides to take the adequate path.
