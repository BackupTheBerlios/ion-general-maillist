Makes perfect sense, now that I've used winsplit-revolution for a few
weeks (though less than 5% of my computing time is spent in a Windows
environment). I still find the tiling function more useful over Windows'
basic tiling options, but it's nowhere in the league of ion that I hoped
it might be.

I see, thanks for the brief explanation.

An rpm for i386, and the rpm spec file for ion3 are now available at:

http://timandahaf.googlepages.com/ion3rpms

These are mainly for Fedora/RHEL systems, but might work on other rpm
based distros too. I will keep these updated as best as I can. x86_64
rpms will be added soon.

Message-ID: <4A54851F.5080801@butovo.com>

Greetings.

To begin with, here is screenshot: 
http://forumbgz.ru/user/upload/file10231.png

the system is Gentoo, font "Terminus". this is raster font.
As you can see, xterm recognizes it and renders it perfect.
The titletabs and statusbar use same font, but cyrillic characters are 
substituted from another font.
The locale is ru_RU.UTF-8, and ion recognizes it. At least at 
ioncore/ioncore.c check_encoding()
returns TRUE and sets ioncore_g.enc_mb=TRUE and enc_utf8=TRUE.

any suggestions?

This is because of an incorrect X locale (en_US.UTF-8 for older Xlib
versions, ru_RU.UTF-8 for newer), and is mentioned on the Ion website
(http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/faq/broken_software.html).

You'll need to replace the file
/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/XLC_LOCALE to something like this:

https://files.getdropbox.com/u/725005/XLC_LOCALE



If you are using Gentoo, I suggest you to use the following modified
ebuild for Xlib:

https://files.getdropbox.com/u/725005/libX11-1.1.5.ebuild

(it expects to find the replacement XLC_LOCALE in its files
directory).

With best regards,
     Vladimir

You mean you want some other font in Ion for cyrillic?
You can _try_ to specify multiple fonts in the fontspec,
separated by commas.... But it probably won't work in
an UTF-8 locale. That part of Xlib is broken, and the
fucktards in power refuse to fix it, instead insisting
that you use their "modern" blur-fascist wheel-reinventing
crap.

A better solution is to just switch to Windows.

Better solution is adding ru_RU.UTF-8 to Xorg. I don't know why they
still didn't it. Most of distros have it without additional
installations.

Hi all.

I'm using ion3 and I never change the version (ok that's bad, I known).

But when I have a new computer, I need to re-install ion3. I using FreeBSD
7.2 and after some time I make ion3 working (last version I find on
website).

But when I use F12 to exit ion that's don't work (only thing). 

After I press F12 I've got 

	Main menu --> session/sortir (I using French)

and I've a
	
	No entry for 'session/sortir'

Where I'm make my mistake ? 

Thanks for advance. 

Regards.

Does it show up in tab-completion? Could there be some
accent issue? Are the locales correct in that case?

Thanks for your answer.

I'm not sure what happen but now it's working, maybe my computer

Yes I think, something like that, because now it's working but the command
is in english (not a problem for me, event my english is very poor).

Thanks again.
