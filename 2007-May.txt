Subject: kinda newbie, nestet WS and emulating sticky
Message-ID: <20070502104934.GA5146@anita.doom>

Hi Folks!

After a long time of absence to ion3 I am back starting to use it again. 

I have two questions about some stuff I was playing around with in older
ion3 versions. Now I am not able two integrate nest_ws.lua into my
environment, ist it somehow deprecated actually? IIRC this gave me to
features I used:

I could attach a float ws into a frame in a tiled workspace, I got this
by tagging a workspace and attaching it into a frame, is there a way to
attach a new one? On the opposite I could attach a tiled WS to a frame.
If I attach a tagged tiled workspace the frame is put onto a tiled ws in
floating layer. Can this be done otherwise, like the opposite of the
above?

I was used to have some frames, mplayer video window, embedded into a
floting frame which was present on all worksapces, emulating sticky
mode. Can this still be done?

Kind Regards, Konsti

Subject: To beat the ugly
Message-ID: <463871CA.9060307@yandex.ru>

Hello!

The Iceape 1.0.8 (from Debian 4.0 Etch) has a strange dialog "Save As" 
which tryes to change it's window size.  For some reasons Ion3 don't 
want to allow the window's size to change so that dialog remains 
shrinked and unusable.  The ugly method is to make it fullscreen but its 
not beauty...

Other trouble is in XTerm or Midnight Commander.  From time to time (I 
couldn't find any correlation with something) the MC runned in XTerm 
just created gives 80x40 layout and all the console apps thinks the 
XTerm has this layout.  BTW I said "XTerm*geometry: 80x40" in 
~/.Xresources.  Can it be the reason?

Thanks for cool frame manager! :)

Best regards,
Evgeny

There's a typo/copy-paste error in the latest release, which causes
size requests to be ignored..

Yes. You'll have to attach a floating frame directly to the screen
in unnumbered mode, and with suitable size policy. See the scratchpad
module for an example. It's doable from the Lua side too. Also
there's Mod1+K D to detach windows, but it won't make them sticky,
and I can't be arsed to write official sticky support. It should
be possible to write a script that turns frames sticky , by attaching
them directly to the screen as explained above. When they're not sticky,
they're attached to the tiling's group. When a frame is attached
directly to the screen, it can be toggled on and off independently.
It's transients will also be toggled on and off independently. It is
also possible to attach frames to unnumbered groups, so that the
whole group can be toggled on/off. I've changed the scratchpad to
do this, actually.

Well I uninstalled the debian package and compiled an ion3 by myself
with clean Makefiles and the configure step explained in the sources
regarding debian's lua lib.

This binary works fine :-)

I just upgraded to the latest darcs snapshot. Transient windows aren't

mentioned a "typo/copy-paste error in the latest release" which affects
this - is that relevant to the darcs code too?

For quite a while now, I've been using "docker" in a floating dock in
order to swallow a few icons/systray stuff. Since the upgrade, they
aren't showing up anymore. I haven't upgraded docker or any of the apps
that display an icon. Has something changed in ion?

Thanks, Mike

Right. I thought I'd have that though, having done the darcs pull yesterday. 
However, looking at the log at 
http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/repos/_log/ion-3.html.gz, it seems like there 
haven't been any changes since 2007-03-18. Am I missing something here?
Also, not being very knowledgeable w/ respect to darcs, I'm simply doing 
"darcs get --partial http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/repos/ion-3" - is that enough 
to get the latest and greatest? 

Thanks, Mike

Do you mean the error in handling size request changes, or another bug?
I applied your fix for that to the Debian package.

Sorry, I thought by snapshot you meant the last tagged and tarred
version.  Looking at the download web page, I see the word is used also
for the latest repository version, which is confusing.

There certainly were some, but I don't see them any more.

I believe it should be.

Subject: Scratchpad vs. access focus history
Message-ID: <85ejlu64jo.fsf@boum.org>

Hello,

I just started using Ion3 (20070318), and playing with LUA to make it
suit my needs. Yes, I've read the "Reporting bugs" FAQ and was able to
reach #6 :)

There's one thing that annoys me : the ioncore.goto_previous function
does not ignore scratchpads, and this is what happens :
  - I toggle a scratchpad display on, then off
  - I run ioncore.goto_previous() a first time : this toggles this
    scratchpad display on
  - I run ioncore.goto_previous() a second time : nothing happens

(NB : I'm using the named_scratchpad contrib. Anyway, what I'm
describing above happens with the standard *scratchpad* as well as
with my own named scratchpads.)

Is this the intended behavior ?

If yes, I want to write in LUA a function that would act just as
ioncore_goto_previous, but would ignore the scratchpads from the focus
history list. But I could not find how to access it in LUA. Is it made
public to LUA ? Or is there a way to access a WRegion's active_next ?
Or am I bound to do it in C ? I've seen the wcirculate contrib seems
to manage its own focus history list, using the appropriate hooks, so
I guess there is no other way, but I hope I'm wrong...

Also known as ion-3rc-20070506.

This is the first "rc" or "(stable) release candidate" release of 
Ion3. This means that there will not be any further major changes 
to it. Bugs will be fixed, and as an exception to the general 
feature freeze, some hooks may still be added, if deemed useful.
Translations may also be included. After no new bugs (that can not
be deemed features) have been found in this or following "rc" 
releases, the stable Ion3 will be released.

Most of the changes in this release to the previous one already
are bug fixes, in addition to some general clean-up. Other notable
changes are:

  * Winprop matching improvements: it is possible to match against
    `is_dockapp` and `is_transient` (booleans), and there's a hack
    to support `class` and `instance` for dockapps too.

  * The default configuration puts dockapps in the statusbar's
    tray area.

  * The autoconf kludge has been removed, as I will have nothing
    to do with it, and nobody else seems to support or maintain 
    it either.

Too much of a codebase to fork anyway. Better go with something lighter. :)

You mean something not worth the distributions carrying at all,
because you need to modify the source to configure it?

Hmm.. that might be a way to stop them corrupting your work.
Too bad such is the extreme example of the "either you're one
of us (developers), or an idiot user" movement that the all
of Linux is turning into, and which is driving me away from it.

Oh, cut off the drama, it was you who ripped off 'autoconf shit' from
the rc, wasn't it?

Again, unless I'm very mistaken (which is fairly unlikely) it was you
who went along the lines of 'me vs {debian,gentoo,whatever} lusers'
some month ago in 'Debian sucks' thread, or was it your special way of
expressing irony towards this kind of attitude in linux?

Autoconf is autopain, a solution waiting for a problem... creating a
problem [1]. Clear and simple makefiles are _much_ easier to use.

I never said there aren't lusers and idiot users. There are, a lot
of them. More day by day, as Linux keeps becoming even sorrier 
imitation of Windows, and the more of the herd finds it. It's just
that there is -- or at least used to be -- a progression of users 
of different levels between them and the developers. You could be 
a luser wrt. one piece of software while being the developer of 
another. The trend in FOSS is either-or: the annihilation of that
progression. Ion does not even try to cater for the lusers, and
the distributions doing whatever they will with it, and still 
calling it Ion, makes it even harder to help them to become not
lusers. Too much of essential FOSS core software, OTOH, these days
only tries to cater for the developers of that software, and the 
lusers.

The state of FOSS is sad. The license ideology of the distributions
(that works for the distributions and the FOSS herd against and using
the author), is sad. Better say goodbye to the sinking ship.

Errm, isn't that the same as having to edit sources to configure a program?

It's about time we agree about what 'linux' stands for. If you prefer
to regard any of those modern linux-desktop trends with the term
'linux', I'd disagree.

My impression is that, these days there is much less stupid questions
on this list than there were three years ago, which makes me think
that users tend to become less of lusers, no?

Having to fix autoconf scripts is the same as having to edit sources,
and worse. Having to edit a well-designed Makefile is the same as having
to edit a decent (non-XML) configuration file.

All the distros are the same shit. Some have more WIMPshit and some
less. All have the same shitty core software designed for WIMPshit
idiot users and the developers (incl. distributors) themselves.

It's just all moved and more appeared on IRC... and private mail. 
The mailing list demands subscription, you know. The lusers can't 
be arsed to do that. I can't either. Yet the mailing list would
be the most appropriate place for the questions... but the best 
weapon against spam is subscription presently.

I must diagree with this point. Luser questions on ion3's ML only
means there are less lusers that use ion3 and bother to post stupid
questions on the ML.

I think a pure luser attitude is to be discouraged at the first
difficulty, so they'd change to another WM before posting their lame
questions. Most of them would not even try such a strange WM (or a
using a non-"mainstream" OS) in the first place.

But you're probably right if you meant "there are less *ion* lusers
now than before".


I don't know about the user/lusers ratio, though I am pretty sure it
is getting lower and lower over time (foldoc:// september that never
ended).

I mostly develop in Ruby and Rails, and the apparent ease to develop
in such a language gathers many, many, many would-be developers (aged
14 to 18 most of the time) that does not have the slightest clue about
what "Object Oriented" means, why MVC stands for, or even why is their
commented code not working.

Reading doc is so painful, when you feel anyone must give you the
right answer and do the work for you.


So yes, in my mind, lusers' number is growing.

Reading documentation is painful, and shouldn't be necessary (beyond
very general documentation) for basic configuration tasks (like 
clear crisp fonts [1], device permissions and aliases, etc.). Reading 
documentation should only be necessary for more advanced non-luser
configuration. In Linux these days, the non-documentation reading 
alternative is provided only through WIMPshit, if at all.

Ion also isn't perfect in that respect, and I think going for
full scripting support may have been a mistake in the end (but
then again, maybe Ion wouldn't have a lot of the small nice features
it has these days, without it), but I've tried to make the basic 
options rather tolerable (just copy over cfg_ion.lua). See also [2].

I want to be a mere (l)user wrt. software i don't particularly 
care about! But I don't want to use WIMPshit; in that case I could
just as well use Windows.

The DOS era was the pinnacle of computing.

Debian will DIEEEE! MUAHAHAHAHAHHA.

I noticed from your posting that Xen has also added trademark terms
to their license. I wonder how long Debian can keep up with the trend,
until they will have to change their policies to respect the authors
a bit.

Then again, FOSS will DIEEE! MUAHAHAHAHA. FOSS has become irrelevant,
offering just the same shit as Windows all over again, and no real
choice.

So next time there's a bug in a release like the one with size requests,
we'll just have to wait for your next release rather than retrieving the
fix from your repository?  Or make a local fix?

This deliberate inaccessibility seems like a good way to deter (l)users
from following and getting involved in Ion development.  This doesn't
seem to fit in with your apparent wish for "a progression of users  of
different levels between them and the developers".

Debian takes the position that authors read and understand the licences
they place software under and that Debian should therefore act within
the terms of those licences.  It is not our practice to guess that the
author might have meant something else.

If the FOSS herd and distributions change their manners and
policies, and start respecting authors a bit, and communicating
with them instead of just doing what they please, the repository
might come back. But if all they want is for the author to be
a workhorse for their own forks or ancient versions (renamed or 
not) -- which is what most people will install due to the power 
distributions have with their easily installable packages -- 
well, they'd better really be prepared to really work on those 
forks.

Ah, but most of the lusers will be using the distributions' forks.

The (L)GPL 2.* are not quite up to date with the power that 
distributions have emerged with. I see that GPLv3 actually 
includes provisions for additional terms governing the use 
of the name of the project, etc.

Since the site requires registration, I'll just say it here: many of
the names at <http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?p=69522> are 
GAIM vs. AIM all over again, or even more associable to Ion. If
you want the name to be associated with Ion, it should be 
"Ion soup (something)" (referring to the old saying about too
many chefs stirring the soup).

I thought FOSS was supposed to be about cooperation. Not that I've
seen much of that. No, most of the FOSS herd is just competing on
how to make Linux suck more. Well, I'm a clear loser in that match,
because I'm thriving for the exact opposite.

I managed this fine a couple of years ago on my University Solaris
account. It was just a case of the standard ./configure and make, IIRC.

Also, you can try the wcirculate.lua script. It filters windows (be
careful: windows, not frames) by the specific boolean winprop:
winlist_ignore. It works for me.

wcirculate is obsolete. The same (and more) functionality is included 
in the Mod1+K K binding `mod_menu.grabmenu(_, _sub, 'focuslist')`.
You might want to study that code. (The `focuslist` menu puts windows
with activity at top, `focuslist_` doesn't.)

Hi,
recently a fellow developer with gentoo contacted me with concerns about
your license change. So that's why i'm here today.

Simple question: your license states that anything distributed as "ion"
must not be altered in any way. Gentoo distributes an ebuild that allows
our users to select whether to include patches by useflags.

Patches we apply unconditionally are at the moment only affecting
configuration (adding ion-lock) or the buildsystem (--as-needed, paths).

I'm seeking clarification on whether we can still distribute an ion-3
ebuild under the name "ion3-$version".

That is not true. Minor changes can be done, as explained in the 
license file.

> (adding ion-lock) 

What's that? Some script that finds a working screen locking 
program? (I've actually thought of having something like that
in the standard setup, and ion-terminal too, to move that out
of the config files. But I never got around to that, and now 
it's frozen.) That kind of changes are permitted, because not 
all platforms can be expected to have the same programs available.

> (--as-needed, paths).

That flag is seriously broken, BTW.

---

Other unapproved patches applied by the building scripts are also 
ok, as long as the user must explicitly request them for (catch-all
USE=all etc. must not apply them), and is highly aware that there's 
no point in coming crying to me after that.

Really, the extra license terms should be no problem to any 
reasonable distributor that primarily wants to provide Ion
as I meant it to be within the constraints of the platform,
and does a reasonable effort of keeping it up to date. The 
terms are there remind to that shit flows upstream -- until
the reservoir breaks.

Right, i missed your clarifications on the bottom. Sorry for that.

From what i can tell from the patches, it just calls xscreensaver if
existant, else uses xlock.

I don't personally use it, to begin with. But there have been users
inquiring about, providing patches, and as it's really just a one line
change, i added it for their convience. Might make that conditional on
--as-needed being in LDFLAGS, though.

_rc will include a postinstall message that tells users to reproduce
with a vanilla build before reporting bugs upstream plus a note that
encourages users to go file the bugs at bugs.gentoo.org first.

I've seen some of those patches, and they're ugly workarounds to
--as-needed being broken. They should not be needed, if the flag
weren't broken. (Although perhaps it would be better to include some
more explicit library dependencies in modules' Makefiles. Few of 
Ion's modules specify the libraries they use -- and can not at build
time be linked against ioncore, as the symbols are expected to be 
provided by the binary. Some modules don't compile with --as-needed
without specifying some of their library dependencies, but others do,
and yet --as-needed is supposed to only remove unnecessary explicitly 
specified dependencies.)

And how easy it is to overlook such a message? In a huge batch build?
Is this also mentioned where the extra flags are documented 
(or "documented")?

While i recognize the fact, that --as-needed doesn't (and probably never
will) catch up with some of it's use cases, i see no point in denying a
"fix" for a broken --as-needed, even if it's not against the ld or gcc
codebase.

The message will use elog, which is user configurable and some of our
users have it mail them the output. In one case, namely the paludis
package manager, elog messages get shown at the end of the complete
batch build. In every case, the user gets a log file with the messages
the package emitted.

The use flags will have a (unsupported upstream) added to their
description.

I didn't say that. I just said that the flag should be fixed rather
than keeping such workarounds there forever.

I don't think that's quite prominent enough. Also "unsupported 
upstream" doesn't have quite right the connotation: it could
be mistaken that the particular feature is not supported. 
The words "upstream support void" would perhaps be more to the
effect. There's also the problem of users getting instructions
from elsewhere, and never reading the description, or the log.
Therefore, the flags themselves should perhaps be prefixed
"support-void"; cmp. "warranty void" stickers on devices. 
(For FOSS there's no warranty, of course.)

You should RTFMATSSCAHLYHNHB. (You should read the fucking manual and
the stinking source code and hack like you have never hacked before.)
That is, there is no simple option for that, but it is possible to 
write a script to generate such a menu by studying how the existing
menu is generated, and adding a bit of extra code.

I have done likewise. Apart from solaris compiler fighting, the home
directory install went perfectly the normal and expected way. I  also
installed lua there first. After a bit of rtfm, now when I log into a
ray (using "CDE" as the desktop selection), ion comes up. Joy.

Last few days a have a problem with downloading from darcs repository.
It looks so:

$ darcs get --partial http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/repos/ion-3/
Invalid repository:  http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/repos/ion-3

darcs failed:  Failed to download URL
http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/repos/ion-3/_darcs/inventory
libcurl: HTTP error (404?)

I have my doubts, that this is my mistake, cause I have such issue on
two machines (my home laptop and a PC at work).

Some thoughts?

There is no point. Stop distributing it, Tuomo. You won't stop people

At least, autoconf deals with cross-compilation while most of those
who think that they can write decent makefiles fail to do so. Average
software package will require tweaking sources regardless of the
build/configuration system it employs.

Any of this fails to attract my attention in debian, for example.
Except, probably the case when I discovered that ion3 no longer does
xinerama due to you being somehow upset with xinerama API. Just like
you rolled back to an older kernel, I had to roll back to a
known-to-work snapshot of ion3. And I do not take that 'mindless
consumerism' shit; I can tell what's convenient for me from 4+ years
experience with dualhead setups and ion.

If cross-compilation needs more than changing the compiler used 
and/or its flags, and library/include paths, that system is fucked
up. (Alternatively a chroot jail should be used.)

Debian is a complex fucked up mess.

Not the API -- there isn't much of it; just that the whole thing 
is a pointless [1] exercise in mutually incompatible extensions, 
which combined with ICCCM incompleteness in the nested WM window
department, makes it impossible to get working Right. Given this,
the state of the planet, and the general distaste I have for the
consumerist culture, I'm not going to waste my time supporting 
and helping anyone enlarging their penises with multihead 
configurations.

Convenient or not, I doubt you have a justifiable (to me, not the
FOSS herd and other conspicious consumers) need for a multihead 
setup.

How can you tell if malloc(0) in target's C library returns zero or
behaves like glibc's, for example? What with 1500 of such little
conditional settings? Defining all those in a makefile is what I
prefer to call being fucked up.
Does ion3 cross-compile at all, btw? Does luac produce 100%
architecture-independent bytecode?

I'm not a poet, but it still sucks less.

Again, the only major concerns of mine (with debian or not) is ion's breakage.
You've taken to talk a lot of fud recently, btw.

Oh right, now with xinerama being supported in ion for so many years,
you figured out that problem. However, being a mere luser in the
context of window management, I don't care since I've never hit any
problem with that and now with xinerama support removed my feelings
are hurt.

Now you sound like those sinister FOSS people from your previous mails
and blog entries. Being asshole towards not-completely-dumb users for
no apparent reason (or should I say: a problem that may arise in a
galaxy far-far away is not really a convincing reason?).

Want to talk about penises?
And yes, here in Russia we're totally buried in consumerism. My BMW
X5, for instance, has a platinum steering wheel.

I can walk my way to New Zealand sooner than you accept the
probability of the fact that you're not 100% right sometimes, let
along the xinerama thing. I don't feel like wasting my breath on this
any more.

Every program containing the same slow-to-run, unmaintainable and
broken M4 mess to check for those 1500 such little conditions, is
what I call fucked up. Autoconf is an ad hoc solution typical of
the FOSS herd and its cherished "worse is better" fallacy, that 
is itself worse a problem than the original [1].

Luac produces architecture dependent code.

Sucking less is not good enough, when the base level is so low.

And for that reason let's have 1500 pieces of software each one with
it's own private little "clean and simple" Makefile. Utter bullshit.

That [1] entry is full of fud also. As for autoconf, it's a known and
tolerable way to get things done IFF you know what you're doing and
don't get bored in 10 minutes just because there's m4 and you can't or
won't read it. Nobody really likes it and it's still there.

How do you tell an enlarged one from a naturally big one?

The point is that I did not have to look at how ion works for several
years now and I don't even remember what a module is in this context.
Now I'll have to dig this again and then install everything by hand
once a month. Too complicated for a luser, now that even autoconf is
carved out.

You're full of FUD. I'm sick of programs with broken autoconf 
scripts that take ages to run, and that are practically unfixable.
I will have nothing to do with the autoconf mess, since better 
solutions are possible.

I didn't have to look at how font systems work for several years, and
then they made everything use Xft and fontconfig, and now I have to
spend hours on it to get nice clear crisp fonts.

I didn't have to look at how device mapping works for several years,
and then they started the SCSI-mapping insanity and practically 
demanding udev. Now I have to waste hours to create a fucking symlink
in /dev.

>> Yes, and my bicycle has diamond frame. (Seriously, it has.)

No, SUV the size of a high-rise building is the penis enlargement
trend over here. The bicycle is a mere transportation necessity, 
assuming you agree that people need to move around faster and
longer distances than is practical by walking -- which isn't much
given the low densities. There's practically no public transport
thanks to the trend of enlarging penisis with the infernal machines
known cars, and the bicycle beats it in ecology in any case.

(And, yeah, "diamond" above of course refers to the standard 
bicycle frame shape.)

Note, that I'm not trying to talk you into merging autoconf scripts
back, all I was saying is that the fact that you're uncomfortable with
something doesn't make it suck or "a fucked up mess". Statements that
you make here are solely based upon your feelings and you try to use
as if they were objectively correct which is often not the case.

With regards to cross compilation capability it obviously is not.

Deep inside we're all scared and lonely and offended by those FOSS
developers doing what they please. So that's why you mistreat your
users likewise?

Those penises that can't afford this type of enlargement still often
have an urge to be enlarged somehow.

Have you tried mod_xinerama?  There is a Debian package (currently
ion3-mod-xinerama; may need to be renamed) and it has just entered the
archive.

Objective correctness is fiction. All that matters is what I think.

I'm not going to waste time serving the fancies of the FOSS herd,

is make my life more difficult and laboursome.

Maybe, but it can be something as simple as a bicycle model that 
suits your style, and such small differences have quite insignificant 
environmental impact, on a vehicle that runs on your own power and
demands little space. (Recumbent tricycles can demand quite a bit of 
space, though. It could also be argued that aluminium frames should 
be used less than they presently are, in favour of heavier steel 
frames that only tend to be used on very basic and el cheapo bicycles
anymore. I'm not sure if such out-of-the-sight construction materials
fall into the penis enlargement department, though.)

-10C is nothing. -20C is still quite tolerable. In -30C breathing
has become quite difficult, but it's still doable. (Some cheapo
components designed for warmer climates don't seem to like it much:
I broke one crankarm in such temperatures just by standing on the 
pedal. Derailleurs also start to freeze, when you have to leave the
bike outside for the day.) Walking starts to become more convenient
below -20C, though, as it demands more warming motion than cycling, 
and has less chance of making you breathless.

I'd actually like to try skiing for commuting in the winter -- it's 
faster than walking, and also demands more warming exercise than 
cycling -- but the vehicles of terror (cars) having consumed most
of the space, with all the rest being squeezed on narrow gritted
multi-use paths that frequently intersect the largely dry asphalted
domain of these infernal machines, it's not possible.

I think it (and other modules I don't care for) should somehow indicate
that it will void upstream support. This could be done with names like
'mod_xinerama-for-ion3', 'ion3-support-void-mod_xinerama', etc., but
an unignorable notification might also suffice.

Hi!

I've just updated a very old revision of ion3 to the latest RC. It
appears that one of the script I use, min_tabs, stopped working.

I modified the MOD1 to META thing, but there's still a problem with
floating workspaces.  I'm just some kind of lusers, but as such, what
I see is that windows in a floating workspaces are now frames [1] and
the test

    if obj_typename(fp) ~= "WFrame" then
	-- Escape: floatws thing should not be handled
        return
    end

never fails (the obj_typename is always WFrame).

Any idea how to fix that ?

Thanks !

Footnotes: 
[1]  Speaking of which, is there a way to restore the old behavior of
     the ? mouse on window selects it ? ? Or at least, when clicking on
     a window ? Well, and my M-<tab> doesn't work now, but it's probably
     just a wrong config line.

The above package names are, of course a bit cumbersome. One possibility
pointed out to me, would be to name unofficial modules according to the
scheme 'mod_(supportvoid|unsupported|unofficial)_xinerama'. Then the 
distributions would not have to give their packages peculiar names.
I don't want to force module authors to use this scheme [1], but I 
do recommend using it.

  [1]: They're not the problem. The problem is distributions 
       effectively hiding this and other information (version,
       patches, etc.) that the user would gain by using the 
       original sources.

Hi all, 

A couple of problems with the latest release (ion-3rc-20070506):

- Some transient windows still aren't entirely functional, for example
the firefox 'save as' dialog goes haywire after more than one size
change (if I click 'Browse for other folders', the size change is
honoured, but if I collapse the window after that it starts jumping
between sizes).

- The scratchpad sometimes occupies the whole screen and can't be
resized (at least I don't know how to do it, the usual bindings have
no effect). 

Thanks in advance,

Michael

Any window size jumping (supposing you mean what I think) is likely
to be the result of application not complying with the ICCCM. Gtk 
apps are notorious of this.

Works for me. Maybe there's some problem with upgrade from an old
version? Try destroying the scratchpad (by closing it), and opening
it again.

I don't remember this happening in earlier versions (but I'll check
before I shoot my mouth off). What's strange though is that the first
size change request is ok - only subsequent changes cause a problem.

Yes, that works, thanks. I'm not sure about any upgrade issues -
I went from a recent darcs repository version to 3rc-20070506 -
something in saved_layout.lua maybe?

It happens on e17 too.
Basically the save-as dialog oscillates between two sizes, horizontally.
Maybe you upgraded to gtk-2.10 ?

Well, yeah, so we have to wait for a new release, isn't it?? Or have I

Yes. The repository is gone until we see what the distros do.
If they end up simply providing their own forks.. well, I'm 
not going to be their workhorse. 

(Presently it seems that Debian at least is likely to simply 
include a dirty hack in the package to check that it is the 
latest, and possibly include ion3-old-$version packages in
the following stable releases. Not that there are likely to
be any Ion3 releases after the next stable Debian is out.)

hi to all,
i'm an italian user of ion3 running on a debian unstable pc,

- make the ~/.ion3/ directory
- put the script in ~/.ion3/
- copy one of {/usr/local/etc,/etc/X11}/ion3/cfg_ion.lua in ~/.ion3/
- add the line

	dopath("script name") 

  at the end of ~/.ion3/cfg_ion.lua

Subject: ion3 eyecandy - gnome-dock
Message-ID: <4649D075.1000100@dadark.de>

Hi all,
although I'm a long-time fan of ion now and using it since ion2, this is
my first post to the mailing list!

I know the whole eyecandy stuff is against the fundamental idea of ion
but I love as well ion as eyecandy..
Well, ok, I'm not talking about fancy window moving effects or
semi-transparent windows or something like that,
but I need at least one eyecandy and, I have to admit, I like OS X and
Aqua ;) At least parts of it.

One part I really like is that cool dock application.
Now I've spent my last night looking for a clone of that app - and I
found one.

It's called gnome-dock, you can find it at http://www.gnome-dock.org/,
and it looks really great.. In gnome :-(
In ion it's not really nice, it's surrounded by a large black border,
making the actual window being 3-4 times larger than the panel itself ;)

I now would really like to know whether there is any way to integrate it
into ion.. That would be amazing.



Thank you a lot
Pascal

I guess Tuomo's answer will look like that :

RTFFAQ (item #4) : http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/faq/entries/Reporting_bugs.html
Which means Gnome is such a pain to deal with that you'd better not even ask.

RTFML : http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/ion-general/2007-March/001786.html
Even a non-Gnome-related requested feature would not have been
implemented anyway.

No. Gnome is an anti-ion. Once you put matter and anti-matter 
together, they annihilate each other.

Yes I did, actually. So it's nothing to do with ion then. Oh well...

So despite the name gnome-dock according to the website it doesn't
actually depend on anything Gnome. It does however claim to require a
compositing manager which ion doesn't have.

So I don't think you will have much luck getting it to look right without
one, if you provide a screenshot of what you are seeing there may be
slight things that can be tweaked to make it look better but I don't know
how much.

Also you are aware that ion has (at least for the moment) a dock module,
correct?

Hi again!

I've another question.. Is it somewhat possible to "connect" two windows 
in different frames (are they called frames btw?) .
To make it a little clearer let's assume I have an instant messenger and 
the buddy list is in one frame, the actual conversation in another.. If 
I now switch to the messanger's buddy list in the first frame, I would 
like the conversation to appear automatically in the second frame.


Thank you

You can use winprops to attach your client windows in the frames you want.
I'm not sure about what you want to do, but I must warn you that very
few (if any)
IM client "correctly" sets its winprops, ie. setting them in a usable manner
(if setting them differently than the buddy list at all). But then, I
didn't try the
new version of GAIM or whatever they named it.

A 'frame' is a split on the screen, the default layout has two (unless
that's changed recently), a 'tab' or 'client window' (cwin) is an item in
a frame.  If you have the buddy list in one frame and the conversation
window in another then you should be able to see them both at the same
time. If instead you mean that you have them both as cwins in the same
frame then you can only see one at a time and if you want to see them both
make two frames.

If I didn't answer your question please try again.

gaim and pidgin have been setting meaningful wm_window_role:s on the
windows for *ages*. I know because I've been using them and made sure they
got put there in the code in the first place. The conversation window, the
buddy list, the accounts window, the preferences window, and the status
window all have roles (as do many of the dialogs though they tend to share
roles).

As already mentioned, you can create such fixed policies with 
"winprops" or ("kludges" or some like to call them, by the name
of the configuration file that contains some defaults), by matching
against the windows' classes, roles and instances, supposing the
application provides such information. Too few applications do
these days.

More flexible policies could perhaps be implemented, if someone
could be arsed to write that FDO startup spec support module, that
I've been suggesting quite a few times. (I won't do it, as I seldom
use applications that would both have the support and could be 
improved by Ion supporting it too. Most importantly xterm and the
shell don't. Plus the protocol is painful, like all FDO shit.) 
Then, supposing that the application supports it too, and sets the
LAUNCHED_BY property, you could have rules like "windows opened by 
windows in this frame go to a nearby frame" or "windows opened by 
this window go in another frame". 

Perhaps it might in this case also be possible to use the "window
groups" of ICCCM, if the application does set the group leader 
suitably, but I don't know if they do (never used any IM, and don't
plan to... unless IRC counts), and I've never bothered with window 
groups. (Applications, or more appropriately "documents", should 
generally have only one window as far as I'm concerned! And the 
prototypical use for window groups is grouping of separate toolbox
windows and such abominations with the main document(s). Perhaps a 
conversion window is a different document from a buddy list, but 
would belong in the same group nevertheless. But does such a group
have a natural leader, which the ICCCM window groups suppose?)

Subject: Cycling through tiled windows
Message-ID: <adb998e60705181028g6396ab85w8a09caf375d688c7@mail.gmail.com>

Okay, probably a very dumb question here.  If I split a screen into
three tiled windows, such as:

___________________________
|                               |                             |
|                               |              B            |
|                               |                             |
|              A               | ____________|
|                               |                             |
|                               |               C           |
|                               |                             |
| _____________|____________ |

How can I cycle focus among all three windows using the keyboard?  I
can Alt-Tab (actually Super-Tab on my box) from left to right, which
would be like A -> B and B -> A, but I cannot move from B -> C or
vice-versa.  To do that I have to use the mouse, which is obviously
less than desirable.  I have read through the docs and the config
files hoping to see something which may relate to this in the
bindings, but there seems to be nothing there beyond the side to side
action.

Surely this is possible, but for some reason I am overlooking it.  How
exactly would I manage to cycle through all three of these windows?

The defaults provide no way of _cycling_ through them: the movement
is geometrical. RTFM:

   Bindings for tilings and tiled frames [mod_tiling]

       Mod1+P, Mod1+N, Mod1+Tab, Mod1+K Tab
              Go to frame above/below/right/left of current frame.

Oh, I see.  I guess it just seemed natural to think that I would be
able to cycle through all windows seamlessly.  Perhaps I got that
thinking from using ratpoison, which seemed to work that way.

Many thanks for the info.  Don't know why I overlooked that, but I
figured it was a dumb question.

Subject: Sloppy focus with Floating WS
Message-ID: <12c5d10b0705202218u8d0a6eeg9349731ba7519a5a@mail.gmail.com>

Up to today I have been using ion3 20060524, so my question may be very out
of day.

I installed version 20070506 today and noticed that floating workspaces
don't use sloppy focus anymore. The only way I can cycle through floating
frames is by clicking on their title bars. Tiled workspaces work as
expected: mouse-over gives focus to the appropriate frames.

Is this intended behavior for floating workspaces, or do I have a
configuration issue on my end? Could anyone help me with regaining sloppy
focus functionality with floating frames?

Thanks in advance,
-voltaic

Might I clarify, that the log (as a reminder) might be enough if
the options themselves already contain the information in condensed
form. The whole point of the "name policy" is that the user knows
what he's doing, and therefore must explicitly request for additional
features and old versions, and know that they're unsupported. If
the use downloaded the official tarball, it would automatically be
the latest. If he would then patch it with random patches from the
net, anyone who is not a semi-moron should know that the version
is unsupported. Distributions may provided "shortcuts" to applying
such patches, and they may provide old versions, but they should
still approximate the process the user would go through when patching
the official tarball, or obtaining an older one.

I think I will refine the "Ion soup" part to something like follows,
to avoid confusion:

    b) The standard non-significantly modified version must be
    provided by default. Options may, however, be provided to
    modify the program on the user's explicit request, when these
    options make it clear, that the modified version is no longer 
    supported by the author, and not considered the standard version.
    The version displayed by the program must be updated to mention
    the modifications and the unsupported nature.

Something like 'USE=ion3-supportvoid-xft' should do that, with
additional reminder in the log or wherever.
Likewise, old versions may be explicitly requested for. If not,
the installation should fail or ask whether the user really wants
to continue. The best way to do the old version check is probably
a "dead man switch" somewhere in the packages or tools. The crudest
form is packages that start complaining when they're more than 28
days old. A more refined form would have packages download a small
database of triples (package, upstream-version, checked-when),
updated in the distribution's repositories either automatically or
manually by the package maintainer. (Checking upstream version and
Setting the switch once a month should not be that much work. 
Package maintainer should pay at least that much attention.) Then,
the package or package maintenance tools would check whether the/a
package request to be complained when upstream-version does not
match, checked-when is too old, or this information is not available.
With package maintainer comind and going, such a _service_ would be
useful -- essential even -- in general. Users could also use it to
check whether the version provided of other packages by the 
distribution is too old to bother with -- which is too often the
case, maintainer MIA.

Source-based packages that already download the official tarball,
might also simply want to use the 

	http://iki.fi/tuomov/dl/ion-3-latest.tar.gz

(and .asc for signature) redirection. Obviously the package may
break when I release a new version, but that should give the
package maintainer a bit more incentive in updating it...

--

Also forgot to mention that the dead man switch DB would only
have to be downloaded by the package maintenance tools' update/
sync process. An alternative approach currently apparently taken 
by Debian is to check the package's site for the version on every
install, which is quite ugly.

Your system is too loaded... probably loading Gnome or KDE shit... 
Or perhaps your using some additional meter that takes ages on load,
or $MAIL is huge.

mod_statusbar/main.c 

It's a huge 5 seconds by default -- longer than a program should wait.
I will do something about it for the next RC. The simplest approach
is to not wait. It's not strictly necessary, but there are some
benefits: 1) calculating the statusbar size before workspaces are
loaded. If this is not done, it may be necessary to considerably 
adjust the current layout later on. 2) Displaying error messages
in the same xmessage as rest of Ion startup errors are displayed.

I'll probably go for the next simplest approach: wait just a few
seconds, and if there's not enough response, don't wait, but don't
fail either. It's a dirty hack, but much simpler than other 
possibilities.

(I don't particularly like the present statusd that much. It's in
general a quick and dirty hack. I'd like a better general-purpose 
one, that used unix sockets, etc. DBus would in theory also be an
option -- in principle it's just the right thing -- I just don't 
like the complex API that much, and the UTF-8 monoculturism [1]. 
Not that I plan to write a better statusd, but it's a project idea
for someone.)

OpenOffice provides C-W and C-Q to respectively close one document and
all documents.
This is certainly not a ion problem.

Maybe you can try Ctrl+W which is not ion-related

This is almost certainly an ooffice bug. Mod1+C simply sends the 
WM_DELETE message to the window, that the "close" button in more 
conventional WMs sends. Does ooffice exit then too? Certainly it
shouldn't.

The next simplest and ... WISE approach. "Huge 5 seconds"
are ZERO, provided the delay is constant. (I know about
what I am talking, I am using a P166 with 32MB and an ATI
card with 4MB--an acceptable, functional box still, no
kidding.)

Much worse and irritating are programs that start in 0
seconds once, in 10 seconds another time, and in 4 a third
time.

A program that regularly lets you wait 5 seconds, and
whose complexity is beyond writing just "hello," is okay.


Cheers,

Yes, I think that's it. I'll try to find the evildoer.

I've tried 10 s without success. So I will identify the "bad" monitor first.

Hello!

I'm newbie in Ion (I've used just a few days) and I've a question:
How can I run programs (gkrellm, gtubeclock, peksystray, liferea,
mail-notification) at Ion startup?
I'm using ion-2-20040729 and start via "startx" (I don't use *dm).

I've tried in ~/.xinitrc ( ion & gkrellm ) but it doesn't works :(

Any suggestions?

Thanks.

Subject: Detach a transient from a frame
Message-ID: <vpqwsytc55x.fsf@bauges.imag.fr>

Hi,

I'm trying to detach a transient window from its parent in ion, using
WTiling. Some applications require interaction between the application
window and a transient, and in this case, having two real frames for
the two clientwin is handy.

Here's the current state of my work :


detach = {
   
}

function detach.topmost_transient(group)
   group:managed_i(function(cwin) 
                      if cwin==group:current() then
                         io.stderr:write("attach " .. cwin:name() .. " to " .. group:manager():name() .. "\n")
                         detach.cwin = cwin
                         ioncore.defer(function ()
                                          --ioncore.detach(cwin, 'toggle')
                                          group:manager():attach(cwin)
                                          detach.put_in_group(cwin)
                                       end)
                      end
                      return true
                   end)
   return true
end

function detach.put_in_group(cwin)
   local m = cwin:manager()
   ioncore.defer(function()
                    local g = m:attach_new({type = 'WGroupCW', name = cwin:name()})
                    g:attach(cwin)
                 end)
end


The first problem I have is that it seems the clientwin are usually
not attached to a frame, they're instead managed by a WGroupCW, whose
manager is a WFrame. If I attach a WClientWin directly to a WFrame,
then ioncore.detach(_, 'toggle') doesn't work anymore for it. So I
tried to reproduce the usual behavior with detach.put_in_group(), but
then, I get some strange behavior. For example, if I detach this
WGroupCW, and then resize it, the WClientWin doesn't resize. And if I
do MOD-c on the WGroupCW, then the WClientWin is closed, leaving an
empty WGroupCW.

What am I missing?

Thanks,

You have to make the client window the "bottom" of the group. 
(Set bottom=true in the attach parameter table). Also note that
you don't need to attach the window separately to the group;
you can attach it when creating the group with attach_new.
(Set managed = { { reg = cwin, bottom = true, ... }, }, )

One more thing: The name=cwin:name() setting is also unnecessary,
because the "displayname" is always the bottom's name, when bottom
is set.

It should be unnecessary, but there's a bug. The name remains
WGroupCW<something> until the first redraw (resize the frame or so).

Here's the result :


detach = {
   
}

function detach.topmost_transient(cwin)
   local reg = cwin
   while obj_typename(reg) ~= "WGroupCW" do
      reg = reg:manager()
   end
   ioncore.defer(function ()
                    local g = reg:manager():attach_new({type = 'WGroupCW', switchto = true})
                    g:attach(cwin, {bottom = true})
                 end)
   return false
end


function detach.topmost_transient_fl(cwin)
   local reg = cwin
   while obj_typename(reg) ~= "WGroupCW" do
      reg = reg:manager()
   end
   ioncore.defer(function ()
                    local g = reg:manager():attach_new({type = 'WGroupCW', switchto = true})
                    local cwing = cwin:geom()
                    ioncore.detach(g)
                    -- g is a group of window, we set the size of the containing frame.
                    g:manager():rqgeom(cwing)
                    g:attach(cwin, {bottom = true, switchto = true})
                    g:goto()
                 end)
   return false
end

Hmm. Maybe I'd call it a feature :). The name of the group does not
change, and displayname changes are not signalled at all.

However, if you do as I explained in the follow-up posting, the name
should be initially correct.

OK, I didn't understand the explanations at first (btw, {bottom = ...}
and {reg = ...} are not documented on
http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/ion-doc-3/ionconf/node7.html ).

I think I've got it now:


detach = {
   
}

function detach.topmost_transient(cwin, float)
   local reg = cwin
   while obj_typename(reg) ~= "WGroupCW" do
      reg = reg:manager()
   end
   ioncore.defer(function ()
                    local cwing = {}
                    if float then
                       cwing = cwin:geom()
                    end
                    local managed_list = {{ reg = cwin, bottom = true}}
                    local newparam = {type = 'WGroupCW', sizepolicy = 'free', switchto = true, managed = managed_list, geom = cwing}
                    local g = reg:manager():attach_new(newparam)
                    if float then
                       ioncore.detach(g, 'set')
                       g:goto()
                    end
                 end)
   return false
end

Look in cfg_ioncore.lua, there's a comment about "Forward-circulate focus".
Below it there are two keybindings. Change 'left' and 'right' to 'next'
and 'prev'.

Subject: split at root broken when statusbar is full screen
Message-ID: <f3kat5$m36$1@sea.gmane.org>

If in cfg_statusbar.lua I set fullsize=true, split at root stops working.
Tested in ion-3rc-20070506.

A lesser problem is that a root split doesn't do anything when there's only
one frame.

A behavior that you may or may not consider a problem is the way such splits
are merged. If I split the screen twice normally, a frame always merges with
a frame that is adjacent to it. If I split the screen twice, but the second
time is a root split, the right/bottom frame merges with the left/top one
instead of with the middle one.

The problem was that the code can't move the statusbar "out of the way",
when the root node being operated contains the statusbar (the stdisp node)
as immediate child. This is because the split tree "balancing" code only
does simple "rotations" of the tree (cf. rotations in red-black trees), 
and does not change in it considerably. In consequence the statusbar 
always has the same parent node. I worked around this by operating on
the non-stdisp child of the root node in this case.
