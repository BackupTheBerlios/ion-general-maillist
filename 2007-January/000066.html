Depends what you're doing, of course.  Often I'm working with ITU
standards (X.511, etc.), and I have those in PDF.  For that matter,
quite a few API docs seem to be in annoying frames-requiring HTML,
which don't really squash that well.

Depends on how the member state has implemented the EU directive, of
course.  And how that law's interpreted by courts and companies.  In
the UK I believe the intention is that the Distance Selling
Regulations provide a similar experience to consumers for things
they've bought at a distance to what they'd get in a shop.

Specifically, if we buy over the web we can't (necessarily) see the
physical box, read what it's got on it, etc.

I believe the law here's usually interpreted (by vendors, anyway) such
that if you actually open the box (and, even worse, plug the device
in), then you can no longer use the DSR to return it.

And the legislation only applies to consumers, not business purchases.

Yeah, I'm waiting for the flexible, printed, high-resolution display.

In the meantime using two relatively cheap TFTs seems reasonable.
There's lots of experience producing them, so presumably there's less
wastage than with less common varieties (unusually high resolution,
maybe even widescreen, though I guess widescreen ones are common
enough now).
