Try 'xev'. It can say you what events the 'xev' window receives. So you
can see if it is some key of keyboard, or if it is "mouse wheel" (mouse
wheel often behave as next/previous in firefox - as it generates mouse
button 4 & 5 click*). Then you can edit your ion config files to set
apropriate binding (kpress or mpress).

*) Another X-related braindead thing...

Hi!

I like the concept of Ion, though I have yet to try it "for real" (I've only
been playing around in it so far). Kudos for such a nice WM. :)

There's just one thing I miss, that I haven't found in any of the tiling WMs
so far; There's no way to set up templates to tell your apps where they
should go. :(

What I mean, is this; Say that I have a few workspaces.  I use one for
internet things (web, IM, chat), one for multimedia and handling my files,
one for the GIMP, and one for developing stuff.

My internet workspace has the contact list and RSS feed in two areas to the
right, a bar at the bottom is for chat stuff (IM and IRC), and in the space
left is my browser.  Browser has perhaps  80%*80% of the workspace.

My GIMP workspace has the toolbars to the right, and everything else is
floating on top of the grid, with the toolbars being on top of course (for
easy access).

My multimedia/file window, meanwhile, has a media player in a narrow strip
at the bottom and a file manager with commander-like structure at the top.
About a 60/40 ratio. If I play, say, a movie, I want it to appear as a
floating window on top of this.

Finally, my developer workspace, has a terminal at the bottom, and Emacs at
the top, 75/25 ratio with Emacs taking up the upper part of the screen.

Now, I hope most persons here are mature enough to see that this is not
ideal for everyone; it sucks on a small resolution for one thing. But I like
it this way. Only problem is, it doesn't get saved when I have to reboot
(damn kernel devs can't design a proper secure kernel... ;)). So I have to
spend 10-20 minutes on getting everything up-to-speed again.

So, I'd like to see what I call "Workspace Templates" - You basicly define
which programs open where (per default that is). This would require a small
configuration change. Below is an example of such a file (modify it as you
see fit);

[Workspace 1]
name=Internet

[area]
workspace=Internet
dimensions=80 80           // In percentage
location=left top
name=browsers

[area]
workspace=Internet
dimensions=20 50           // In percentage
location=right top
name=rss

[area]
workspace=Internet
dimensions=20 50           // In percentage
location=right  bottom
name=contacts

[area]
workspace=Internet
dimensions=40 20           // In percentage
location=left  bottom
name=irc

[area]
workspace=Internet
dimensions=40 20           // In percentage
location=left top
name=imchat

[programs]
item=firefox browser
item=akregator rss
item=pidgin contacts
item=pidgin-chat imchat
item=xchat irc

There's only one thing missing for this puzzle; how to handle child windows
from applications? Otherwise I think it should be pretty straightforward to
develop. Though, I am not really a developer, so I might be wrong.

Thoughts? Comments?

Regards,
- Per Ekstr?m

Do winprops not help?  Or did I misunderstand you?

Hmm, and your workspaces were not autosaved? Did you terminated ion, or
just killed/crashed it? Try quitting/restarting ion after you set up the
workspaces (via ion's menu or appropriate lua functions). The layout
(i.e. framework without applications) should get saved.

As csant wrote, winprops are for placing new windows in correct frames.
You can also disable it afterwards, if you want the default place under
pointer behaviour later.

As others have pointed out, there's "winprops" [1], that can be used to
some extent. In particular the 'target' and 'new_group' properties are
useful in this case. The former will specify an existing frame or so,
and the latter the name of a stored layout for a new group to be created,
if the 'target' didn't exist. You can copy-paste the configuration of
a group you have created from the layout savefile (removing references
to client windows), and pass it to ioncore.deflayout to give it a name.
(Also see cfg_layout.lua for examples of layout definitions.) Give useful
(unique) names to the frames within the layout, and you have a sort of 
template system. It's a bit clumsy, but then apps don't exactly help us
here, and haven't found myself wanting an improved version of the feature.
You could do something better with Lua scripting, perhaps.

Are you asking to be able to type a unique leading section and then just
hit enter to activate the full match? So assuming "foo" has only one
possible completion "foobar", you want to be able to hit your query
keybinding, type 'foo' then hit enter directly?

"Autocompletion" is generally an annoyance. Ion only has "auto-show
completions" (as well as more traditional tab-completion;
mod_query.set{autoshowcompl=false}).

There's also a potential fix in the darcs repo for ion-doc-3,
changing the load order of the html package after hyperref.

Message-ID: <26056dfc0803060207o642600abj6979a918a9beab2d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have install ion3 on my freeBSD 7, I only needed to tweak system.mk like
this:
* Comment for dl library
#DL_LIBS=-ldl
* Uncomment this line
DEFINES += -DCF_NO_LOCALE -DCF_NO_GETTEXT
* And set value for the LUA.

So, compilation work perfecly and ion3 use work fine. But I can't access to
the ion3 man page (No manual entry for ion3). But when I search ion3 man
page on my disk, I found that:
/usr/local/share/man/man1/ion3.1
/usr/local/share/man/fi/man1/ion3.1
/usr/local/share/man/cs/man1/ion3.1

Someone know why I can't view ion3 man page ? Maybe there are no link
between man page system and ion3 man page. In fact, I really don't know how
work the man page system...

Thanks for your future help...

Alex

What's your manpath (echo $MANPATH, manpath, ...?)?
Do the local man pages go in /usr/local/share/man or /usr/local/man?

In FreeBSD the man page ?must? in

	/usr/local/man/

so just do

	mv /usr/local/share/man/man1/ion3.1 /usr/local/man/man1
	mv /usr/local/share/man/fi/man1/ion3.1 /usr/local/man/fi/man1/
	mv /usr/local/share/man/cs/man1/ion3.1 /usr/local/man/cs/man1/

"Don't hold your breath." Sure will not. 8-)

I have met a cobra in the bathroom, two-three nights ago. No kidding. Of
course it has attacked, given the limited dimensions of a bathroom. (In
one-two seconds up in a 'S' position, loudly exhaling--the sound is exactly
the same--like an angered cat, and then jumping forward with the speed of a
dart at the fourth-fifth second.

I have managed--still can't believe it--to not be bitten. In my
rationalizations, I have been rescued because of the exhaling of the cobra: it
has changed tonality [because of the effort] the moment the snake has begun to
project itself forward ... I was not believing at my eyes otherwise and would
have been to slow/late. I have jumped in the air backward like a cat [have
grown within cats in a family who was mad for/loving cats] Long life, anyway,
to the PS2 games [with reference: motoric and reaction training] I play from
time to time.)

Off-topic, I know.

Cheers,

Subject: ion-3-20080207 won't compile: lua incompatibility?
Message-ID: <15f314a40803180749j6a2856d8hfacb74d7151d6355@mail.gmail.com>

I try to compile ion-3-20080207, and get the following:

Scanning main.c for exports.
/usr/local/bin/lua: ../libextl/libextl-mkexports:211: 'string.gfind'
was renamed to 'string.gmatch'

Making the obvious change, and re-running make:

/usr/local/bin/lua: ../libextl/libextl-mkexports:30: bad argument #2
to 'format' (number expected, got string)
stack traceback:
        [C]: in function 'format'

        ../libextl/libextl-mkexports:795: in main chunk
        [C]: ?
make[1]: *** [exports.c] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/ion-3-20080207/mod_tiling'
make: *** [subdirs] Error 2


...At which point I am starting to think that this could go on for a while.

Is Ion not compatible with this version of lua?

"""
7 - Incompatibilities with the Previous Version

Here we list the incompatibilities that may be found when moving a program
from Lua 5.0 to Lua 5.1. You can avoid most of the incompatibilities
compiling Lua with appropriate options (see file luaconf.h). However, all
these compatibility options will be removed in the next version of Lua.

...

  * Function string.gfind was renamed string.gmatch. (Option LUA_COMPAT_GFIND)
"""

file://localhost/usr/share/doc/lua5.1-doc/doc/manual.html

(Or the same doc from web, the but lua.org is dead-slow, so I can't
be bothered accessing it.)

So it should bejust your compile that is incompatible. Or have they
changed the compile options between 5.1.2 and 5.1.3? Which would be 
fucking braindead. (I can get them completely removing gfind for 5.2, 
but not changing options between 5.1 releases. Or just disabling it
by default in the whole 5.1 series -- which would've made discovery
of this change easier -- but net between 5.1 releases.)

I have managed to get an ebuild for gentoo to install ion3-20080207
(the latest, according to the website).

It will also install the mod_xinerama module that was posted on this
list a while ago, if you specify both "xinerama" *and* "unsupported".

http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Installing_3rd_Party_Ebuilds tells you
how to add the ebuild into your portage system.

Given that your path to lua is /usr/local/bin I'm going to assume you
built lua yourself (though I suppose you could be running a bsd as well)
and that you probably just didn't build with the compatability defines on
(the ones that Tuomo mentioned).

So you can either fix all the locations that need fixing or rebuild with
the compatability defines turned on.
