Rewrites in The Language of the Day are lame (see also the .signature),
for people with a lot of time in their hands and no original ideas.

</I>&gt;<i> *expressivity* oblige.)
</I>
C works quite well, especially combined with Lua for the tasks that
are not nicely done in C. Working on Ion's code, I don't often run
into the limitations of C, because I have my frameworks written ages
ago. What would make sense is gradually moving some of auxiliary C 
code to the Lua side.

I really don't like writing the kind of stuff a window manager is in
Haskell. It's too painful. The language just isn't meant for that kind
of stuff. Dynamic data structures (e.g. objects) are _pain_; perhaps
the best way to get around this is _heavy_ threading, every object being
its own thread... it's an academic exercise that I have no time for, 
and of little practical benefit over a tried C implementation that 
works today.

&gt;<i> I skip mentioning other advantages in general, moreover I am sure Tuomo
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly knows that Compiled Haskell is as fast than C
</I>
Bullshit. It's very very laboursome to make fast Haskell code, and
especially such that doesn't eat gigabytes of memory for breakfast.

Lie, statistic, benchmark.

Liar, politician, software advocate..

&gt;<i> Lua may be fun, but Haskell (and other modern functional languages) are no

</I>
Haskell is fun for academic exercises. Real-world programs are pain. 
Plus the Haskell build environments are shit. GHC is infinite
pain to install anything under. All these language fundies (which
includes the majority of FP people) are always reinventing the OS
for their language only, instead of using the operating system's
tools (such as the file system).

&gt;<i> dwm and all its clone and derivatives look like nano (the editor), or pico of
