So, I just set up a fresh, clean install of my OS and I'm now
looking to install missing critical software. Which brings me
to Ion3, and you all.

The most up-to-date information I could find was on Wikipedia,
which points me at:
   tuomov's archives: http://tuomov.iki.fi/software
   the Notion fork:   http://notion.sourceforge.net/
   the Anion fork:    http://code.google.com/p/anion3/

What should I be installing? And why are there two forks?

Looking at notion's repo, it has exactly one commit, the initial checkin, so
it's just a copy of ion (without the history). It was useful back when tuomov
had withdrawn all the archives and there was no way to get the source, but now
I think we'd be better off it it went away and stopped confusing people.

Haven't tried anion, I'm still running off a local copy of ion-3plus's darcs
repo from back when tuomov was still hosting it.

Anion project is ion3+ copy with Xft patch, which can be switched on
or off while compiling.

Also this project contains ion3 archives and riot fixed for latest
ghc.

Also it contains additional modules (xkb, xinerama, xrandr)

Erm, sorry for badmouthing the project then - I based my comments on 

http://code.google.com/p/notion/

which is quite dead, I had no idea there's a fairly active SourceForge project
of the same name.

I was wondering about the same thing a while ago. While at that point notion
had little code, anion had been stalled for a good while also and notion 
seemed much more active in terms of community interest and discussion.

Aside from the mailinglist, there is a #notion IRC channel - not very active,
but not completely dead either.

Uh, what repository are you looking at?

The notion repo is can be found at sourceforge git, 
http://notion.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=notion/notion;a=summary

It has the full ion history, some patches, and I actually checked in a bugfix
just 2 days ago.


Kind regards,

Arnout

No problem - I'll try and see if i can get hold of the google code project 
owner. 

(I never saw this project before - I'm not even sure it's the same 'notion', as
I don't see any code or information in that project at all...)


Kind regards,

Arnout

Would it be possible to merge with Notion, or are there strong
philosophical or architectural differences here?

I'm concerned that forking the code in two different directions
will lead to
   a) confusion for everyone
   b) bugfixes of one not going into the other

I would prefer if Notion and Anion provided different make
configurations to provide their different feature sets (if
that's wanted), rather than forking the base, which would
benefit from having both developers maintain it together.
