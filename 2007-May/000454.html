Does ion3 cross-compile at all, btw? Does luac produce 100%
architecture-independent bytecode?

Again, the only major concerns of mine (with debian or not) is ion's breakage.
You've taken to talk a lot of fud recently, btw.

problem with that and now with xinerama support removed my feelings
are hurt.

and blog entries. Being asshole towards not-completely-dumb users for

&gt;<i> and helping anyone enlarging their penises with multihead

</I>Want to talk about penises?
And yes, here in Russia we're totally buried in consumerism. My BMW
X5, for instance, has a platinum steering wheel.

&gt;<i> Convenient or not, I doubt you have a justifiable (to me, not the

</I>I can walk my way to New Zealand sooner than you accept the
probability of the fact that you're not 100% right sometimes, let
along the xinerama thing. I don't feel like wasting my breath on this
any more.

I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me.
