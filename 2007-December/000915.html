The distros' practises.

&gt;<i> Are you talking about Xinerama support here? - the mod which works fine,

</I>
It doesn't work fine. It can't.

&gt;<i> but you have some bizarre

</I>
Morality is bullshit. Religion in disguise.

&gt;<i> As you don't maintain a &quot;stable&quot; branch 
</I>
Utter and total BULLSHIT. Ion2 is the stable branch. But the idiots
behind the distros think they know better than the author, which
releases are stable -- meaning bug-free, not &quot;static&quot; as the distros
apply the term.

&gt;<i> I really don't know what your problem is with AA or udev: Correctly done  
</I>&gt;<i> AA actually helps text
</I>
AA makes text ugly, blurry, and unreadable, compared to decent unblurred
screen fonts. It only helps with shoddy printer fonts--which are no good
without hinting on present poor screen resolutions. But the herd just
loves anti-aliasing and all other new/modern shine, and expects everyone
else to do so too, and crams it down their eyes.

&gt;<i> udev doesn't exactly kick up a stink.  
</I>
Try adjusting device permissions, symlink names, anything. It's pain
compared to just chmod/chown/ln -s. The cryptic config files also
change all the time in the distros, and it takes ages at boot. 
(Its designed hac a complete lack of understanding of the fundamentals 
of computer science, doing a linear search for the correct rules by 
executing 10000 lines of shell scripts, instead of constructing 
appropriate search trees.)

&gt;<i> Ah - you're feeling opressed.  Then again you seem to feel victimised by  
</I>&gt;<i> most walks of life if your blog is anything to go by. I think that's  
</I>&gt;<i> mostly how you view the world.
</I>
Modern technology mostly sucks.

&gt;<i> non-monoculturist? So you'll support xinerama, anti aliasing, udev now  
</I>&gt;<i> will you? Rather than declaring them all to be anti-tuomo.
</I>
No, I provide (preferrably abstract) mechanisms for others to support 
them.

&gt;<i> So you're unable to take a shoddy patch and apply the correct fix to your  
</I>&gt;<i> own code? That seems pretty feeble
</I>
It's more work for me to maintain all that code. The FOSS herd has not
yet grasped the two fundamental principles of maintainable software:
modularity and abstraction (cf. abstract wchar_t and locale encoding
vs. hard-coded UTF-8.)
