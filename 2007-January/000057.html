&gt;<i> Actually, it's not so much about the size of the screen. I don't find

</I>&gt;<i> a slightly bigger resolution (e.g. 1600x1200 vs. 1280x1024... which would

</I>&gt;<i> much of enhancement in either case, as both resolutions are still so poor).

Sure, by &quot;size&quot; I really mean in pixels.  I'm constrained by company
policy to use TFTs (we decided that for reasons which probably aren't
so valid any more, so possibly I could argue against that), so that
limits my choices.  I'm disappointed I can't get the same kind of
resolution on a desktop screen that is available on laptops, but I
imagine the costs (environmental and other) even out (physically
bigger screens probably don't cost much more than smaller ones; it
probably depends more on the number of pixels).

&gt;<i> It's more about the shape. There's horizontally a bit of space left in 
</I>&gt;<i> the field of vision after a 4:3 screen, that a widescreen display should
</I>&gt;<i> fill. You can comfortably fit two A4 papers on a widescreen display, 
</I>&gt;<i> wasting less resources than multihead, that normally will have a lot 
</I>&gt;<i> of screen space outside your field of vision.
</I>
Quite true, although I'm not so confident about the relative costs.

Certainly I don't feel that much advantage in having two screens---a
single one with a similar number of pixels would do just as well
(especially with ion).  I guess if ion regards my existing two screens
as one big one that won't be too bad; it would be slightly annoying on
the occasions where I want to make some application full-screen,
though.
