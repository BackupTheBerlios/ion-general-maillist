Tuomo,
I am consistently astounded by your attitude towards users of ion.

You have actually written a well thought out, very useful, piece of  
software.  The kind of people who are going to be using ion are those who  
work in an &quot;alternative&quot; (we know WIMP is crap, but it is the standard)  
fashion.  My guess is that this bunch of people are also the most likely  
to want to have &quot;alternative&quot; setups and otherwise customise the tool they  
use to get real work done.

However your comments appear to suggest that everyone should work exactly  
like you:

I don't like xinerama therefore:
  - noone could possibly justify the use of a pair of monitors (or heaven  
forbid even more)

I don't want to support month old releases therefore:
  - everyone should be constantly updating to the latest snapshot. And in  
fact compiling that from source - because as far as I can tell you haven't  
been bothered to make an interim 'stable' ion3 for people to settle on.   
In fact I don't think I've ever seen a 'stable' version since I started  
using ion3. How can debian et al. include ion3 at all if you never release  
a stable version?

I don't want to to subscribe to a mailing list...
  - no mailing lists subscriptions ?? wtf? how are you going to get the  
email - would you prefer to use a newsgroup or a bulletin board / forum?  
Mailing lists need subscription so you can see what's being talked about.

The less users, the better. Users are a problem...
  - They are also the point of software - without them software is useless.

For someone who seems to have a reasonable grasp of what makes a decent  
WM, and what user interfaces should be like (which of course depends  
primarily on the user) you present an incredibly arrogant face to the  
world -  something which you may or may not realise.

Don't get me worng I still think ion is a great WM, but you seem to have a  
very odd mental block with regard to people.

John

PS - still using 3ds-20051029 - xinerama support is important to me - and  
this has never really failed me (although I have got an interesting bug at  
the moment, the scratchpad is far smaller than it used to be on my work  
machine...)
