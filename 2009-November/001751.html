<PRE>Hello guys, I've been willing to try (and eventually switch to) ion for some time now, but what keeps me away from it is the scripting language...
Did you check wmii? it allows the user to program the window manager with _any_ language he/she's used to, which I find a good basement philosophy if you ask me.
It doesn't try to link/merge with any language in particular, it doesn't force the user to learn another language just to script the wm; it let's the user have it his/her way. How would this concept play with ion?

I'm reluctant to learn yet another language just for the window manager. No, I don't care there are enough scripts already there, what I do care about is that if I need to do something someone else did not think about and made a script for, I'd have to go through all the hassle to learn lua, which I find far less versatile and readable than my language of choice. Again, this may be just a matter of taste, but in any case, I do not feel like messing with lua, and I think it should not be imposed.

Of course, that's arguable, since there are certain apps that really do impose their own language (like vim, emacs, and some others), but this is usually because any of these reasons:
    * Multiplatform scripting languages did not exist when they were created, so they had to make their own.
    * Available scripting languages did not meet the expectations for the task.
    * They needed a highly specialized language to avoid kludges.
    * They needed a tight integration with the scripting language for performance reasons.

My suggestion? Why not make ion controllable through IPC? maybe a fifo, socket, tcp, whatever, to _let the user choose_ the language to be used.

I'm not saying that ion should be redesigned and reimplemented right away either. It will definitely be rewritten from scratch at some point I guess, so why not keep this in mind when the time comes?

- TC
