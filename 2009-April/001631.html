<PRE>Tuomo -- I certainly respect your opinion.  When it comes down to it,
this is your distribution list, and I would not be a part of it if I
did not want to read about your ideas and thoughts.  So, I wish you do
not take offense to anything I am about to say.  I do not want you to
think I am providing anything more than an ignorant view from a
desktop user.

It seems to me, that if this is what &quot;killed&quot; X, than Windows 95 was
the death of Windows.  And if that had not done the trick, Windows ME
and Vista were two pointblank shots to the temple, leaving a rotting
carcass behind.

However, truth be told, I am not one to firmly state one OS is better
than another.  I use both Windows XP and Linux and am quite happy.  I
tend to think far to much energy is spent trying to convince others of
a particular operating system's superiority over another.  I think all
have great features that can be utilized.

But, like I said, having very little in the way of true programming
experience, I am an ignorant, if not blissfully ignorant user.  I just
see irony in you outlying the increase memory use, cpu power, and
battery consumption; my wife's new laptop with Vista is all that, and
more bothersome for me, it is way to colorful.

I am the weapon that strikes, In the hearts of man I thrive, Feeding
their fear with lies, I will devour I will divide, I am the god of
hellfire, Inside every man there lives a liar, Before their gods they
cower, I will divide I will devour

Antichrist or harbinger of fate, Prophet and priest born of the
ancient rage, I will assassinate their way,  Annihilation of the human
race
