<PRE>
After some discussions, I also formulated the following version,
that is still based on the LGPL. It is more complex, but the
name-related stuff is better separated.

-------------- next part --------------

The code of this project is licensed under the LGPL, unless otherwise
indicated in components taken from elsewhere. It is reproduced below.
Additionally, the following (trademark+copyright) restrictions apply
to the use of the names Ion, Ion3, and other derived names:

  1. Significantly altered versions of this software may not be
     distributed (neither in source nor binary form), by a name that
     could be confused with a name of this software (&quot;ion&quot;, &quot;ion3&quot;, etc.), 
     without additional very explicit component that indicates that the 
     version is non-standard. Such significantly altered versions must
     in no way point to the original author(s) for support.

  3. Redistributions of this software accessible plainly with a name
     of this software (&quot;ion&quot;, &quot;ion3&quot;, etc.), must provide the latest
     release with a reasonable delay from its release (normally 28 days).
     Older releases may be distributed, if the full version, or some 
     other explicit indicator, such as the word &quot;ancient&quot;, is part of 
     the name that the package is accessed with, or if this identifier
     is completely unrelated to a name of this software.

  3. This notice may not be removed from or altered in any source 
     or binary distribution, whose name still indicates it to
     be an (altered) version of this software. It may be removed
     from proper derivative works.

# Question and answers

## On significant changes:

A feature patch to the source code would be considered a &quot;significant&quot;
change. A patch that fixes minor bugs, would a priori be considered
insignificant, especially if it is available from the author. Basic
changes in compiler options and installation paths would obviously
be insignificant. Changes to the configuration files, that merely 
add to the standard version, without obstructing the standard setup, 
would a priori be considered insignificant. Changes to the 
configuration files that are incompatible with the standard setup, 
would be considered significant. When in doubt, ask.


## On distributions:

If the software can be installed with `$pkgtool install ion3` (resp. 
`$pkgtool install ion`), where `$pkgtool install` stands for the install
feature of the distribution's package management tool, this should
always install the latest standard release of Ion3 (resp. in the whole 
Ion project). The action `$pkgtool install ion-3ds-20070318` may, 
however, at any date install this particular marked release. Likewise
`$pkgtool ion-with-tonnes-of-unsupported-patches` may install any 
altered version.


## Proper derivative works

Proper derivative works, i.e. works based on Ion, that no longer
can be considered merely altered versions of Ion, do not have
to carry the above notice. As long as these works are still
competing window managers, they should prevented from being 
given names that could be confused with Ion, by trademark law.
