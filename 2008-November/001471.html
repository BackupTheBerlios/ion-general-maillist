I don't.

Even Ion is far too much work to rewrite, with little practical 
benefit. Rewrites of working code just to conform to fads are 
pure insanity. I rather concentrate my academic wanking on the 
far more interesting mathematics... 

Indeed, one of the biggest obstacles I have in producing new
code is that I'd need to be able to take a lot of time to
properly concentrate on it. But I don't have that time and
energy, and it's always a lot of effort to start working for
a few spare hours on something you only ever look at for 
a few hours every couple of weeks. Maintaining an existing 
codebase that you've previously had more time and energy
to concentrate on, so it's burned into your neural patterns,
is far easier. One should be able to get into The Zone for
an extended period to properly get going with a new project,
but with projects bigger than a single-file hack, it's difficult
to find the time and energy. Indeed, I found The Zone to write 
Riot in, immediately after having lost the shitjob I had back 
then. (One of the best days of my life.)
