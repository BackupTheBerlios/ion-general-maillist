Just like I said, I don't want blame anyone, maybe you right, maybe you
wrong, maybe FreeBSD ports manager right/wrong, I don't known. 

I'm not a developper (the more complex software I ever write is &#171;hello
world&#187;), I'm not a ports maintener.

What I just want to say is I'm very regret there are no agreement between
you and FreeBSD ports Team.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now I need to find something don't exist : another wm such good as ion3.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just compile from source. It's not that difficult.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Of course It's what I'm going to do (try), but the ports collection make all
dependency, and it's very fine technics. 

But the problem for me it's I'm not a programmer, I'm just a sysadmin, and
I think in some year when there lots of modification in all software I'm
not sure I can compile that. 

I'm just look in the old ports collection and there are very few patch in
the ion-3 ports, but maybe in few year they need more. I can only make very
few modifications.

&gt;<i> If there's demand, I could provide a relocatable binary as well...
</I>&gt;<i> Presently no ZeroInstall feed, though, because I can't build its
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies in Frisbee. But ZI is just a convenient way to install
</I>&gt;<i> a tarball with a relocatable binary.
</I>
I can answer that question, IMHO ion-3 is the best wm I ever seen (in
almost 20 years of unix). But all new users use some KDE/Gnome, this kind
of software let you have 3 finger very big by using the mouse.

Event I can't using ion-3 because I can build it I just want thanks you for
all this year with you software.

Regards.
