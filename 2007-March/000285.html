</I>I'd say that would be a reasonable solution, also using troff/ms would
not complicate things (it's all the same as with troff/man - just another
macro package better suited for larger documents (section handling etc.)
the `-man'-macros are posing at tighter frame so to speak: it's obviously the
right thing for usual manpages and it's rather obviously not the right thing for
lengthy stuff such as the `bash' manpage. I really believe that `-ms' would be
better suited  for a tutorial/handbook. display would proceed exactly the same:
instead of calling `nroff -man some_file' you'd do `nroff -ms some_file'. so
it's really a question whether the ms-macros are too complicated to use (they
are'nt, maybe easier than '-man').

</I>&gt;<i> One option might be to use markdown, which generates HTML. That's

</I>which  is just that: a text dump. I'd really prefer to have it formatted
with troff. postscript-output (and thus pdf via `ps2pdf') is just there and 
html-output is reasonable, I think.

&gt;<i> not like ReST etc.; markdown seems to be the only one of these ASCII

</I>yes. or an ms-document: e.g., I believe the system V UNIX manuals are written with 
it (or am I wrong?).
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But, no, Mod1+F1 should not be changed from displaying the reference

to get at the manpage (Mod1+F1 and F1&lt;CR&gt; (I actually use the latter)?
