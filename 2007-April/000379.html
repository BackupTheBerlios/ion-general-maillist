Attached are the contents of the new LICENSE file. I'm fed up with
assholes providing as the standard version, both old versions, as
well as versions with unapproved patches [1]. The new license is
actually free'er than LGPL, if you ask me. It merely acts to guard
what is considered &quot;Ion&quot; or &quot;Ion3&quot;; to give credit where it is due,
without any direct restrictions on code use. (And to give credit
where it is due, I used the Zlib license [2] as basis for it.)

warranty. In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages
arising from the use of this software.

Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
freely, subject to the following restrictions guarding the artistic
integrity of the project:

  1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must 
     not claim that you wrote the original software. Any derived works
     must acknowledge that they use code from this software.

  2. Altered versions must be clearly and explicitly marked as such,
     and must not be misrepresented as being the original software.
     Significantly altered versions may not be distributed (neither
     in source nor binary form), by a name that could be confused 
     with a name of this software (&quot;ion&quot;, &quot;ion3&quot;, etc.), without 
     additional very explicit component that indicates that the 
     version is non-standard.

  3. Redistributions of this software accessible plainly with a name
     of this software (&quot;ion&quot;, &quot;ion3&quot;, etc.), must provide the latest
     release with a reasonable delay from its release (normally 28 days).
     Older releases may be distributed, if the full version, or some 
     other explicit indicator, such as the word &quot;ancient&quot;, is part of 
     the name that the package is accessed with, or if this identifier
     is completely unrelated to a name of this software.

  4. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source 
     distribution.

# Question and answers

## On significant changes:

A feature patch to the source code would be considered a &quot;significant&quot;
change. A patch that fixes minor bugs, would a priori be considered
insignificant, especially if it is available from the author. Basic
changes in compiler options and installation paths would obviously
be insignificant. Changes to the configuration files, that merely 
add to the standard version, without obstructing the standard setup, 
would a priori be considered insignificant. Changes to the 
configuration files that are incompatible with the standard setup, 
would be considered significant. When in doubt, ask.


## On distributions:

If the software can be installed with `$pkgtool install ion3` (resp. 
`$pkgtool install ion`), where `$pkgtool install` stands for the install
feature of the distribution's package management tool, this should
always install the latest standard release of Ion3 (resp. in the whole 
Ion project). The action `$pkgtool install ion-3ds-20070318` may, 
however, at any date install this particular marked release. Likewise
`$pkgtool ion-with-tonnes-of-unsupported-pathces` may install any 
altered version.
