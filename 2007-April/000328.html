<PRE>hi list and tuomov,

i'm one of those wierdos who use ion3 in a xinerama
setup and enjoy it quite a lot (hard-on and all).

consequently i'm a bit disappointed that the support has
been dropped in the latest version. especially since that
new version seems to fix some other annoying glitches wrt
floating transients.

but playing with the new ion i was surprised to learn
that it still works &quot;almost&quot; right for me, even without
knowing about xinerema.

maybe we can get away with a bit of cheating here?

i found only two things that ion really needs to do
differently in a multihead setup:

- on each new workspace create n frames (n=2 in a dualhead setup),
  fix them to the screen-borders and make sure they cannot be
  resized or closed

- never position floats across a screen border

so, how about giving ion a notion of &quot;virtual screens&quot;
through a setting in the config file and working with that?
i imagine the above should be much less code to write than
going for real xinerama support. can someone with
insight comment on that?

compared to the old xinerama-version we'd lose the ability
to have independent workspaces on each screen but imho
that would be a lesser pain than the current issues
with detach.lua in older ion versions.
and maybe, just maybe, even that could be hacked up later on?

what do the others think?


moe
