&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> No, the fix should be at the root of the problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i.e. your licence?
</I>&gt;<i> The distros' practises.
</I>Because tuomo is always right (tm)

&gt;&gt;<i> Are you talking about Xinerama support here? - the mod which works fine,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't cause probles on non Xineramra desktops
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't work fine. It can't.
</I>Oh - then how come I've never had any problems with it?

&gt;&gt;<i> but you have some bizarre
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notion is amoral on some grounds I've never quite grasped?
</I>&gt;<i> Morality is bullshit. Religion in disguise.
</I>I'm sorry I thought I was talking to a rational individual.  Morality is,  
at worst, a societal decree of acceptable behaviour, and at best a clear  
definition of correct behaviour provided by the designer of a system.
I'm guessing you're agnostic since you seem to detest religion so much.

&gt;&gt;<i> As you don't maintain a &quot;stable&quot; branch
</I>&gt;<i> Utter and total BULLSHIT. Ion2 is the stable branch. But the idiots
</I>&gt;<i> behind the distros think they know better than the author, which
</I>&gt;<i> releases are stable -- meaning bug-free, not &quot;static&quot; as the distros
</I>&gt;<i> apply the term.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I really don't know what your problem is with AA or udev: Correctly done
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AA actually helps text
</I>&gt;<i> AA makes text ugly, blurry, and unreadable, compared to decent unblurred
</I>&gt;<i> screen fonts. It only helps with shoddy printer fonts--which are no good
</I>&gt;<i> without hinting on present poor screen resolutions. But the herd just
</I>&gt;<i> loves anti-aliasing and all other new/modern shine, and expects everyone
</I>&gt;<i> else to do so too, and crams it down their eyes.
</I>ugly - subjective
blurry - subjective and dependant on the antialiasing used
unreadable - subjective
You (as admitted below) just hate anything new.

&gt;&gt;<i> udev doesn't exactly kick up a stink.
</I>&gt;<i> Try adjusting device permissions, symlink names, anything. It's pain
</I>&gt;<i> compared to just chmod/chown/ln -s. The cryptic config files also
</I>&gt;<i> change all the time in the distros, and it takes ages at boot.
</I>Never causes me any issues - on personal machines or any of the servers  
(both in office servers and the ~hundred public facing servers we run).
Cryptic config is a pain wherever it is, but it's not as if the ion config  
file is stable in syntax.

&gt;&gt;<i> Ah - you're feeling opressed.  Then again you seem to feel victimised by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most walks of life if your blog is anything to go by. I think that's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mostly how you view the world.
</I>&gt;<i> Modern technology mostly sucks.
</I>Except vacuum cleaners I presume.

&gt;<i> It's more work for me to maintain all that code.
</I>Not if it's correctly implemented when you integrate it.
