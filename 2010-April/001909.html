<PRE>The way I wrote that was a little confusing. My meaning was (if I can do 
better this time) a search for debian+howto+notion will include any 
howto's for debian where someone had a notion since it's a common 
english word. Doing a search for various terms+notion generally finds 
hits from the presence of a sentence in the page about the notion of 
something or other. You're absolutely right, a legitimate page about a 
project called notion should rise above that sort of thing.

I was not however really thinking of the legitimate site for the 
project. Consider a search for statusbar+notion, lua+notion, 
maximized+notion, keybindings+notion. The point is notion doesn't do a 
very good job of focusing the hits in on this project. A post someone 
makes on their blog regarding their experiences with notion containing 
the exact solution some future user is looking for could be very 
difficult to find.

I found this to be the case with the name ion, without the '3' it's a 
very bad filter, and since people often drop the '3' in discussions 
about it, with the 3 it's a very bad filter.


&gt;<i> Excerpts from panman's message of Thu Apr 08 10:25:25 -0400 2010:
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd like to suggest that it would be preferable if the word chosen for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the new name be easily searchable. That is to say, someone doing a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> search for &quot;notion howto&quot; or &quot;neon howto&quot; are going to get all kinds of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bad results.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a good point, but looking around, I'm not so worried about it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> google: notion howto
</I>&gt;<i> about 65,100 results
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> google: neon howto
</I>&gt;<i> about 170,000 results
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The notion hits don't look like they make a lot of sense; I suspect real
</I>&gt;<i> HOWTOs regarding a window manager named notion would sort quickly to the
</I>&gt;<i> top of the list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The neon hits include a hit about the neon library on the first page.
</I>&gt;<i> Unlike the commercial software named notion, which is unlikely to cause
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of confusion, neon is a library which is likely to be on many
</I>&gt;<i> users' systems [I have it as a dependency of openoffice and subversion
</I>&gt;<i> for some reason I'd prefer not to theorize about].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ++notion
