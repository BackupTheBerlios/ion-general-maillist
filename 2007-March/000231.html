One should not completely trust the popular press, though. The
original reference may be (<A HREF="http://www.it-environment.org/compenv.html">http://www.it-environment.org/compenv.html</A>),
and the quote there says:

&quot;&quot;&quot;
Manufacturing computers is materials intensive; the total fossil fuels used
to make one desktop computer weigh over 240 kilograms, some 10 times the
weight of the computer itself. This is very high compared to many other
goods: For an automobile or refrigerator, for example, the weight of fossil
fuels used for production is roughly equal to their weights. Also,
substantial quantities of chemicals (22 kg), and water (1,500 kg) are also
used. The environmental impacts associated with using fossil fuels (e.g.
climate change), chemicals (e.g. possible health effects on microchip
production workers) and water (e.g. scarcity in some areas) are significant
and deserve attention.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

So the amount of fossil fuels used would be more like 1/5:th that of 
a car, which is still by no means a small number. However, this number
does not seem to be the energy used: 1000kg of fossil fuels is not even
comparable the amount a car burns in its lifetime, and as I said, the 
energy in that is comparable to the energy used in the production of 
a car. So it could be that the press got their number from elsewhere 
in the book, or that the number has not even been calculated.
