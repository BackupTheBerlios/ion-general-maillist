</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I agree: scratchpad as the sole location is no good for this. but why not make
it available instead of the ion3-manpage with MOD1-F1?  the manpage everyone
will be able to access otherwisei -- be it via F1 (where it is the default
anyway), be it via some xterm.

having the tutorial come up with MOD1-F1 (and an initial xmessage at first
startup that it is there to find) would be a good thing. It could even still be
in `man' format. (or some more flexible troff macro package, such as `ms'. one
then could even use the troff preprocessors such as `tbl', 'eqn', `pic', but
keep the ability to get a reasonable ascii/latin1 approximation of the formatted
document in the terminal).

I recently convinced some colleague to dump GNOME and try out `ion3' (hey!
and just for the record: he at that point tried to compare `ion3' to `wmii' and
immediately dropped the latter due to it's inability to manage his second
monitor). 
what I noticed, then, were two things:

1. the list of default keybindings and available actions is somehow there in the
manpage but people have difficulties at first to understand the terminology
(workspaces, clients, objects, frames etc.) and thus difficulties to understand
what the commands do. conclusion: the tutorial should try to make this easier to
grasp.

2. more important is to tell the users, where to configure what and how: in
other words, each explanation of an action/keybinding should be augmented by the
name of the config-file where I can change the binding. suggesting a strategy how to do
customization in such a way that it survives with minimal damage any update
would be helpful, too (if you simply copies over everything to ~/.ion3 and edits
this heavily you've to start over from scratch the next time, if the
default config-scripts have changed due to update. probably some kind of
`dopath' strategy would be the best thing to suggest?).
