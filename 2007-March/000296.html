</I>what file? the markupped text? I don't think that `ms' markup is harder (or 
easier) to understand than latex markup. for the macro definitions themselves:
yeah, that's sort of crazy (but probably the low level TeX stuff does not look
better). looking at the documentation as a prerequisite of generating a
sensible document: would you say that is different from latex???

&gt;<i> That doesn't lend to random contributors improving the documentation.
</I>tell me: where is the difference between `-ms' and `-man' markup in terms
of your points (random contributors don't understand it, 'old', etc)?

</I>same thing with groff (being a program), of course.
so: you know how to use latex, I know how to use groff. that seems the basic
difference.
concerning &quot;understanding&quot; the latex source: I will give you that latex markup
is much more verbose (which I don't like: I have to type it or make lots of 
vi shortcuts or what else) and therefore one could easier guess that

\begin{paragraph}

is just that, than that

.LP

(for left adjusted paragraph) does just the same in `groff -ms'. but the 10 odd
pages I sent around concering use of `ms' seem to compare rather favourably to
the length of the average latex guide...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it would'nt harm if one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would not loose this option without better reasons than that the tutorial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would simply not pop up via `man tutorial'.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I still think that using such arcane formats as *roff is pointless, 
</I>&gt;<i> unless you're writing a man page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I still think you are wrong but will leave it at that. but hey, guys, why not,
at least put this in a file `tutorial.txt`:

.\&quot;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TL
ion3 tutorial
.AU
some_guy
.AI
some_institution
.NH
Introduction
.LP
is going  here
.NH
keybindings
.LP
can be found here in a nice table:
.\&quot;-------------------------------
.TS
box center tab(;);
l l.
key;action
_
F1;access manpages
F2;xterm
.TE
.\&quot;-------------------------------
.NH
customizing your statusbar
.LP
can be tough.
.NH 2
statusbar: the basic layout
.LP
is here
.NH 2
statusbar: extensions
.LP
are here
.\&quot;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
things to memorize to 'read' the above: 

`.\&quot;' -- is the admittedly strange start_of_comment .
`.TL' -- title
`.AU' -- author
`.AI' -- author's institution
`.NH' -- starts new numbered section header (trailing number is section level) 
`.LP' -- starts new leftjustified paragraph, 
`.TS/.TE' --  brackets tables ('table start', 'table end') 

now issue :

1. `groff -t -ms tutorial.txt &gt; tutorial.ps; gv tutorial.ps'
2. `groff -t -ms -TX100 tutorial.txt'
3. `nroff -t -ms tutorial.txt'

and look (and compare with what you need to achieve approx. the same with `-man' or
`latex' (where latex is not an option if one wants to maintain formatting into
the terminal)).

my vote:
best solution: use `ms'
second best solution: use `man'
