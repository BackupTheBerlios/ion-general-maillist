</I>
Well, British broadcast _humour_ is better, because the Finnish
equivalent is absolutely non-existent. That is, unless your 
concept of humour is a the level of a three-year-old.

&gt;<i> Okay, but this is for the lucky ones in Kokkola or
</I>&gt;<i> Lappeenranta! (I never have been in Finland, and I am
</I>&gt;<i> Swiss, by the way.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here where I live (West Sumatra) the temperature on
</I>&gt;<i> the day is around 30 C [and 25 on the night ... at sea
</I>&gt;<i> level]. The air humidity goes up till 80% and beyond
</I>&gt;<i> [evening/night or raining seasons], which makes 30, even
</I>&gt;<i> 25 C feel like 40 in Zurich, Lugano, or Helsinki,
</I>
When it's 40C in Helsinki (in shade), the hell has frozen
over (and migrated on the equator).

And yet the Finns seem obsessed with air conditioning these
days... I'm freezing in this office! Stuff your AC where the
sun _does_ shine!

Really, there should be no need for AC at these latitudes,
at least if they knew how to build decent buildings with
decent natural ventilation... but no, even natural light
is too difficult these days.

Well, the use of AC is a self-reinforcing need...

&gt;<i> I own an S73 series BenQ JoyBook, which I like VERY, VERY
</I>&gt;<i> much, I recommend you, and is KICK ASS for the buck [the
</I>&gt;<i> display is GORGEOUS by the way ... BenQ oblige]. (&quot;Too
</I>&gt;<i> Fucking Expensive,&quot; are you thinking at Lenovo, Toshiba or
</I>&gt;<i> Compaq? Agreed then.)
</I>
All the semi-tolerable laptops I've seen are upwards from 
1500e, which is too much considering the kind of fragile
consumer junk the devices are, and how much real use I
would have for one. For under 1000e you can only get 17&quot;
GlareScreen -- now with a mirror, for the same price! --
dragtops with battery life not much better than my 486.
It's funny how in laptops the smaller the screen, the more
expensive it is, whereas normally it would be the opposite
(assuming the resolutions aren't hugely different).

&gt;<i> I use encrypted swap, so I can't suspend the mP, 
</I>
Linux software suspend support totally sucks... it
should not be necessary to compile your own initrds
for restore from encrypted swap. ... It should be
necessary to compile your own initrds for faster
boot process using the stock kernels. It should not
be necessary to touch initrds at all, directly, for
decent non-idiot box performance.

&gt;<i> Nor I do spin down the hard disk--for reasons.
</I>
I actually spin down two of the three disks of my
tabletop computer (w/ noflushd), because they're
used only infrequently and eat a lot of electricity.
(athcool is nice too... no I _do not_ have fancy
frequency scaling shit.)

&gt;<i> You may thankfully understand that given people with
</I>&gt;<i> a notebook are glad if they can monitor two-three
</I>&gt;<i> ACPI-things, not just because it makes fun or is gaga.
</I>
And the Ion statusbar isn't sufficient for that?
Although, I suppose that for warnings an OSD might
be nice... I'd actually like an OSD log kind of 
replacement for xmessage... integrated with Ion's
window activity/urgency  stuff.
