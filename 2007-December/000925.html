That's the FOSS herd's cherished worse-is-better fallacy for 
you. Once the shoddy quick&amp;dirty solution is popular, it is 
difficult/expensive to fix it. If people only would stop to
think and ask for input before embarking on writing crap.

Don't get me wrong, worse-is-better is quite ok for some
projects, mostly marginal ones, and to which it is feasible
write many alternatives to. Ion development pretty much follows
that approach, and Ion is not particular beautiful code, although
there are some aspects I like. But essential core software, of 
which There Can Be Only One (in practise), demands different 
standards -- far higher standards.

&gt;<i> Yep - if the last &quot;stable&quot; release you made was over three years ago.
</I>
Sorry I don't have infinite amounts of time for working on Ion,
unlike the paid developers of the more popular projects that are
turning Linux/FOSS into a steamping shitpile.

&gt;<i> I've not gone back, because ion3 is actually pretty stable - for  
</I>&gt;<i> everything I do. 
</I>
There are some pretty bad bugs/omissions even in the latest 
release. Comes from working on the code very intermittently.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Except vacuum cleaners I presume.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They have the unfortunate tendency to blow.
</I>&gt;<i> See - you do have a sense of humour :) I knew it was there somewhere! :-D
</I>
I thought I only had bad humour. Well, one does occasionally make 
mistakes.
