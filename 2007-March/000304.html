it's not so much whether control-x is better/worse than mod1-K. it's using two
keys here, which is annoying. of course if the keyboard is exhausted, 
that's the way to go for the remaining actions. but right now quite a few 

mod1+some_key

combinations are not used at all by default. 
I, too, remapped all the frequently occuring things to such combinations, e.g.

mod1+Q instead of mod1+K-P
mod1+W instead of mod1+K-N

which probably is the most frequently needed action in the whole of ion3, at
least with non-cinemascope monitors (maybe together with mod1+TAB, so having these
three near each other essentially takes care of 95% of the navigation).

so while I guess that the mod1+K scheme came about due to your use of `joe',
I believe that the minimum number of keyhits should be aimed at, i.e. first
exhaust the two-key kombinations for the frequent actions than use three  keys
for the more arcane ones.
