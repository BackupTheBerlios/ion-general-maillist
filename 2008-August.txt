Subject: Preventing windows from grabbing the focus
Message-ID: <20080819045528.638da3a2@pero-macbookpro>

Hi,

I am working with a java application (IntelliJ IDEA - a java IDE) that
requests the focus after each and every operation. So if I for example
start to compile my project within that IDE, switch to firefox on the
other frame then the focus gets stolen bei IntelliJ IDEA as soon as
compilation completes. 

This is absolutely annoying and has been reported as bug for both the
IDE (http://www.jetbrains.net/jira/browse/IDEABKL-3849) and in a
slightly different context for Java itself.
(http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=5094112).

It would be great if I could just disable the focus request. Is this
possible? I already searched the web, the documentation and the
newsgroups for hours and hours but could not find a hint.

Regards

Peter

(As a side note: When the app steals the focus it does not fully
"activate" the frame. If the other frame is floating above the frame
the app is running in then the app is still beneath that other frame.)

Unfortunately, focus change is not a "request", unlike geometry change.
Geometry changes get forwarded for the WM to act upon, and according
to the ICCCM, it can do as it pleases, and the app must not fight
back. (Many do, these days!) Focus change messages are acted upon by
the server, and are honoured when they can be (i.e. the window is 
visible, no active grabs, and so). AFAIK ICCCM does not discuss 
whether the WM is allowed to overrule such changes by switching
focus back.

PS. A more proper way for apps to actually _request_ the WM to
give focus, instead of forcing it, is the NET_WM_ACTIVE_WINDOW 
protocol. Ion ignores it by default, although it can be activated
with winprops.

Tuomo,

thanks for your answer even though this is very sad news :(

Focus changes are the most annoying thing to do and I don't
understand why software developers do that...

Anyway...

Regards

Peter

make all

it finishes but with many instances of

    Substitution of arg to newlabelxx delayed.

    Unknown commands: bullet voidb_at_x else docode urlstyle unhbox
    fi phantomsection ifpdf lstinline

among other complaints.

(I am using the last rubber from darcs; and I know, Ion's doc is included a
forfait anyway.)

Search for newlabelxx suggests that latex2html is complaining.
(What can you expect from a HTML converter? TeX is shit being
a programming language. But there still isn't anything better
around.)
