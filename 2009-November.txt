Check if the script provides %workspace_pager_n (n=0,1) or
something like that. If not, then modify it to do so.

Resending this as it seems not to have made it through the first time.

That's just a limitation of statusbar_workspace, you can either modify the
script to do what you want or use my statusbar_wsname which supports this
out-of-the-box.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0911171916400.7880@Core2Q6600>

Hello guys, I've been willing to try (and eventually switch to) ion for some time now, but what keeps me away from it is the scripting language...
Did you check wmii? it allows the user to program the window manager with _any_ language he/she's used to, which I find a good basement philosophy if you ask me.
It doesn't try to link/merge with any language in particular, it doesn't force the user to learn another language just to script the wm; it let's the user have it his/her way. How would this concept play with ion?

I'm reluctant to learn yet another language just for the window manager. No, I don't care there are enough scripts already there, what I do care about is that if I need to do something someone else did not think about and made a script for, I'd have to go through all the hassle to learn lua, which I find far less versatile and readable than my language of choice. Again, this may be just a matter of taste, but in any case, I do not feel like messing with lua, and I think it should not be imposed.

Of course, that's arguable, since there are certain apps that really do impose their own language (like vim, emacs, and some others), but this is usually because any of these reasons:
    * Multiplatform scripting languages did not exist when they were created, so they had to make their own.
    * Available scripting languages did not meet the expectations for the task.
    * They needed a highly specialized language to avoid kludges.
    * They needed a tight integration with the scripting language for performance reasons.

My suggestion? Why not make ion controllable through IPC? maybe a fifo, socket, tcp, whatever, to _let the user choose_ the language to be used.

I'm not saying that ion should be redesigned and reimplemented right away either. It will definitely be rewritten from scratch at some point I guess, so why not keep this in mind when the time comes?

Not quite. Such a generic scripting interface inherently has to stick to
the lowest common denominator.. and hence it should really not be the
main extension/scripting interface, I think, but a more simplified 
"command interface".. For more thoughts on this, see

> I'm reluctant to learn yet another language just for the window manager. 

"Baawaawaa, it's not written in My Language Of Choice, so it must be
rewritten." That describes something like 49% of FOSS projects
The other 49% is "baawaawaa, it's not Free?: it doesn't use My 
License of Choice". The remaining 2% may have some originality.

There really is not much to learn in Lua, and if you can't pick up 
a language  "on the go" -- especially as simple one as lua, with 
a very short official reference manual -- you shouldn't be programming
at all. It's not like you need a high level of proficiency for 
scripting. I've written plugins for programs written in perl, ruby,
and python, and I have never taken the time to properly learn them, 
don't really like them (Lua is _much_ better, except for the 
library selection), and would not start a project using them 
myself, unless there was some very compelling reason (library 
availability or such).

> which I find far less versatile and readable than my language of choice. 

Then you haven't even bothered reading the basic description of the
language, and are criticising just because it's not Your Language of
Choice.

It's not imposed. As far as I know, nobody has to use Ion, as it's
a marginal alternative among a gazillion other window managers.
It's not XFascistType, pukedev, Hardware Obstruction Layer (of
the Year) or other core software that the only way to avoid is 
to not use Linux/*nix. Which is exactly what I have done.

Why don't you do that?

Actually there is mod_ionflux, that you can use to send Lua code...

Ion is not being developed.  For details on any possible future, see

I had to learn lua because of Ion, and guess what...  I learnt the
basics in 2 hours. After that I was reading only the ion's
documentation.

Although I'm not good at lua I will choose it as conf. language for my
next project, because of its learning curve.

I was using ratpoison ages ago... but it did not work at the
end...Maybe one day I will give it another try. I liked in ratpoison
is that follows the principle of gnu screen regarding keybindings.

I decided to give a try to ion3, for few month now. I never wrote 1
line of code in lua, but to be honest that did not create for me
microscopical pain, after having gone through other at leas ten
programming languages. What created for me a bit of pain instead, that
the functions for manipulating different objects are still not
perfectly documented. I mean 1-2 examples here/there would at least
double the value of the documentation.


> Actually there is mod_ionflux, that you can use to send Lua code...
Hey!!! That is what I was looking for ( I think) to control ion3 from
the console ...

wmii is among that 2%:
- it can be scripted in any language, also in your language of choice
- it is free from restrictions; you may also sublicense it to your free license of choice

ion fulfills neither. I assume you get that 98% of user unsatisfaction, if your 98%/2% numbers are correct.

  Exactly.

  To those who feel too limited by ion's complexity or Tuomo's opinions, I would recommend wmii. I successfully migrated from ion3 to wmii and don't regret it. The migration is easy since they're feature-alike, and it's faster to customize.

Muahhah, looks more like belonging to both of the 49%.
I suggest taking some language classes.

And knowing the history of tabbing/tiling WMs, the 2% is
reserved for a certain other WM or WMs...

Brief summary of my experience looking for a good window manager:

Ion3: not actively developed, also I intensely dislike Lua (this is a
matter of personal taste).  Doesn't integrate with Gnome well.
Installation is easy.  Customization is OK.

wmii (as of 6 months ago): a real duct-tape window manager, lots of
broken advice online because there's like 30 ways to set it up.  Once
you get it going it's all right, but you better have lots of shell
scripting experience.  Doesn't integrate with Gnome well.  Installation
is hard if you don't know what you're doing.  I respect the design, it's
very powerful and flexible, but wouldn't recommend this one to new
users.

StumpWM (as of 2 months ago): pretty good feature-wise, does almost
everything OK, very slow if you don't fine-tune the VM.  If you don't
know Common Lisp it will be very confusing.  I like Lisp so it was OK
for me.  Also it doesn't integrate with Gnome well.  Installation is OK
with Ubuntu.  I would have loved to recommend this one because Lisp is
so flexible but it's just not for everyone.

XMonad: really good in every way, configuring beyond the basics requires
learning Haskell.  To me that was actually a plus, I like Haskell a lot
but certainly it's not for everyone.  This one is very fast, has
multiple layouts besides tabbed (full screen, side by side, etc.).
Supports floating windows, integrates well with Gnome.  Extending it is
easy.  Installation is really easy with Ubuntu and the docs are good
(lots of sample configs and every module is documented).  I'd recommend
this one to people looking to try a new WM, unless they want deep
customization and Haskell is outside their comfort zone.

Sorry, but I'm really not following the focus of the conversation here.
Tuomo explicitly gave his opinions on the direction that ion3 development
should be going, so It seems pretty simple to me: Given the options of WMs,
you use Ion if you WANT to. Not only that, Tuomo gave an explanation on his
choices.

I've tried different tilling window managers, and my 2 cents are:

Awesome(3): is becoming huge project and has alot of "enhancements" over Ion
but at each new version, the config files change and all that backward
incompatibilties arise.

Xmonad: Very well written, fast, and customizable. But since it's
Haskell-based, you have to install a metric shitload of Haskell
dependencies.

dwm: You have to recompile it every time you change something. It's just not
versatile enough for my tastes.

stumpwm, scrotwm, wmii: never tried, will not speculate over those.


In the end, it all boils down to how much you want to customize your WM.
Then, it's all about programing language taste.

I am almost convinced that I would have ended up with Xnomad, but had
the same problem with the metric shitload :)  apt-get install xmonad

If you like Xmonad, but would like it to be slimmer, then you may want
to try dwm.

Yes, you have to recompile dwm to change its settings, but it is fast
and easy, and once you find your `perfect' settings, you are set.

Hmm, yes examples are missing. But otherwise ion3 is documented very
well. There are only few projects with such a good documentation. And
you have also the META+F3 keybinding, where you can test all complex
things and see what they are doing. This combination allowed me
configuring ion very quickly.

Great, thanks! I'll check out your statusbar_wsname (didn't notice the

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0911221458400.24033@india.ece.cmu.edu>

When I hit the fullscreen button inside a youtube video in firefox, the
video just disappears, and I'm left with the browser without the video.
There's no new full-screen workspace created. Pressing either alt-tab or
Escape has the same effect: the video comes back into its original
position embedded inside the browser. I don't think I've ever had this
work correctly in the past either.

Any idea why this is happening/how to fix this?

Using ion3-2009-0110. The issue is probably similar/same as the issue in
[1].

It seems that Flash no longer sets the initial window size to 200x200
sizes but to the current screen size.  So changing:

    match = function(prop, cwin, id)
               local geom = cwin:geom()
               return is_fullscreen(cwin) and geom.w == 200 and geom.h == 200
           end,

to:

    match = function(prop, cwin, id) return is_fullscreen(cwin); end,

makes it behave, though this might have false positives.

Flash seems to do stupid things with window focus.  I had a workaround
for an earlier version of Flash[1] but it no longer works.

Subject: bindings to move mouse cursor?
Message-ID: <f6324db80911231632g164b51cey552168b464465f36@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I have been searching a lot but no luck - is it possible to have some
key bindings that move the mouse cursor (e.g. a given number of pixels
in a given direction) ?

I think that would be a very useful way to switch to the frame you
want, just move the cursor until it's over that frame, should normally
only take a couple of keystrokes. The ioncore.goto_next functions
sometimes don't do exactly what you would want, depending on the
splitting order and such.

Thanks,
Radu

I find it next to impossible to believe that for any even remotely
complicated layout (and even uncomplicated layouts with warping enabled),
that mouse pointer nudging/moving is going to work better for selecting a
desired frame/client than the current "Go to window" query does.

Is there a reason that query is not sufficient for what you want?

The above notwithstanding, ion does not move the mouse, there are programs
out there which can (and even an X accessibility setting which uses the
numeric keypad for this) though.

well, it's a bit like buying a car navigation system and then only using it
street by street ... maybe you should have a look at the commands ion
provides.

In what cases doesn't goto_next work?

The two programs 'swarp' (or 'xte' as suggested) and 'xmousepos' should do  
the trick. (you can find the exact distance needed by finding the current  
frame's absolute coordinates)

If you really want to do that, I suggest a Trackpoint keyboard instead.
The difficult a foresee with key(board) control of the pointer -- based
on experience with keyboard resize -- is control of the acceleration.
You need some kind of acceleration for fast yet precise movement of the
pointer, but with an on/off control device you have to do it based on
hacks based on the time pressed, which is hacky and does not work so
well. Trackpoint, on the other hand, does it by the pressure you apply.
By applying little pressure, you can move the pointer very precisely;
by a large amount of pressure, you're on the other side of the screen
in no time. (Assuming you have sane almost maxed-out settings; the
defaults tend to be crappy, and maybe one of the reason many people 
give up on the Trackpoint, and become ice-skaters.)

Isn't that what navigation systems are all about? If you actually 
bothered looking at the map for a moment, you wouldn't need some 
device to tell you where to go (wrong).

Thanks for your response and for the pointer to your kludge!

I tried to do this, but I still have the exact same problem. I see what
your kludge is doing, but it doesn't seem to fix the problem. Regardless
of whether or not I use your script, when I press the full-screen button
inside the youtube player, the video disappears, and the browser window
gets surrounded by a thin read line (which I assume is the video
window). Any clue what else the problem could be?


(BTW, running ion's window info on firefox tells me its class is
"Firefox", and not "Firefox-bin", so I tried changing it to that, to no
avail).

The red line is probably Ion's marker for the source frame of a detached
window. You can detach/reattach windows with Mod1+K D, but "too big"
transients also get detached automatically... is flash purporting its
fullscreen document window to be a "transient" now? And then it somehow
fails when Ion's detach code keeps moving the window around? Maybe it
even gives the window size hints that force it to be a single pixel,
and hence basically invisible with the minimal transient decorations.
(Ion always applies size hints; modern idiot-applications often request 
sizes that do not fall into the range of their size hints.)

You may be able to find the window id with xprop -tree -root or
something, if it sets any identifying information at all (probably
won't, being modern crapware), and then find the size hints and
the TRANSIENT_FOR property with xprop -id the_id.

I'm not running Linux or even X anymore, so that's all I can help.
