No i ment WEdln.complete() (which is bind to tab). What is the old
tab-completion model?

It would be cool if i could get ion to do shell-like tab completion instead
of the next match. I'm not sure if ion can already do this but i couldn't
find such an option. i'm not a very good programmer, but i had a (very)
quick look at wedln.c but am not to sure what everything does, but still
reading it...  Some more questions :)
- Is there some more documention on (or in) the ion code somewhere besides
  the listing of classes in the ion manual? Starting at the functions that
  are exported to Lua is good, but it is a litle annoying that there is
  no (?) comments in the code about how ion does things..  But maybe i'm
  just looking in the wrong place as usual :)
- the completions are in the edln-&gt;compl_list thing? I got to complete.c
  via wedln_do_set_completions() which calls edln_do_completions() and
  there is a function get_common_part_rmdup() which seems to do part of
  the kind of tab-completion i want. I think the code i want to make will
  be easier (for me) because i don't (?) have to call wedln_next_completion
  (or _prev_) but just can make a litle function that looks at what is in
  the query-box so far, gets the 'context' of the query (?) and then prints
  the biggest common part of all the possible completions and updates the
  autoshowcompletion-box thing. I'm sorry if i sound a bit fuzzy :) i
  haven't got a clear picture (yet- i hope) of how everything hangs together.
  Anyway, if someone can help me get some insight on what the variables
  in the structure (/class) Edln, WEdln and WListing mean or a litle
  description of how the code for auto-completion is structured i would
  really appreciate that!
- edln is the non-visual part and the edit-line and Wedln is the other way
  around right?

&gt;&gt;<i> comes up, but alot of sed-processes get made and my computer gets very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slow!  they also don't seem to end (?) but killall sed fixes it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You know, there's a reason for the note on caching in the README.  Not
</I>&gt;<i> that it takes _that_ long on my system without it, but too long to be
</I>&gt;<i> comfortable. In any case, you want to experiment with ion-completeman (in
</I>&gt;<i> $SHAREDIR).
</I>
Works a whole lot better now :) Thanks!

&gt;&gt;<i> I also have a litle question about scripting ion...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 'man grep'. Also check the scripts repository.
</I>
hehe you're right :)

- anyway, i think ioncore.create_ws(_,my_ws_params,true) will do what i
  want, but is _ for the first parameter the current WScreen (also known
  as the right option)?
- Is there a way to make Ion obey the maximum window size hints (WM_SIZE_HINTS)
  throug winprops so they only work for some programs?  I cannot make
  windows smaller then the application wants, but i can make the window
  bigger which sometimes is annoying because some programs stay at 1 size

greetings - jurjen
