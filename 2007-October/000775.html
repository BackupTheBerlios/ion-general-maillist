I go with the good old 3-button Pilot. Unfortunately, the left
button of my remaining one is dying, which is another reason
why I'm using it left-handed... The scroll wheel is quite 
cumbersome as a third button, often used for pasting. I 
wonder if there are ones with a proper third button and a
scrollwheel... They'd just have to move (in e.g. the present
Pilot) the scroll wheel a bit towards the centre and add a
third button in front of it.

&gt;<i> About the weight: 323 g of the V270. You would not be able
</I>&gt;<i> to make a difference, it's still to little compared with the

</I>
The high weight makes it heavier to move around, and adds 
requirements for the surface you use it on.

&gt;<i> About the touchpad: I think that it makes sense--for *special
</I>&gt;<i> situations* [let's recall that a notebook is more or less
</I>&gt;<i> mobile]: mouse doesn't work for any reason, no space to use it,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. 
</I>
The nipple is preferrable; the touchpad mostly in the way unless
you disable it -- from my limited experience with laptops.

&gt;<i> Example: Helsinki, January, snow, night. Tuomo has just lowered
</I>&gt;<i> the [electric powered] window glass on his side in the car, when
</I>&gt;<i> he discovers that, suddenly, he can't longer lift the window
</I>&gt;<i> glass--for any any reasons: ice, electric motor problem, etc. A
</I>&gt;<i> simple winder would now be VERY welcomed.
</I>
Your example is flawed: Tuomo neither lives in Helsinki nor has or
drives an infernal machine. Tuomo uses highly reliable technology
known as the Oat Engine combined with such a marvel of simple and
reliable engineering known as the bicycle. And against the wind
and snow he goeth.
