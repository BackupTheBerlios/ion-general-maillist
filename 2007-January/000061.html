I quite like having my malleable content on one screen and my reference
content on the other screen. This makes it far easier for me to monitor
email and IRC (on the left display) while reading reference content (on
the right display). Swapping workspaces requires erasing the reference
content when bringing up the malleable content.

This constant erasing and replacing content works against my innate
ability to remember where content is on a page. When I had a single
1600x1200 display, I could fit reference content and malleable content
on screen quite nicely. But it was fuzzy. So I tried 1280x1024 LCD and
found myself swapping content enough that it detracted from my ability to
get work done. So I bought a second LCD and have enjoyed the extra space.

Perhaps I've waited long enough to treat myself to a new display with all
the space I need. :) (Pity my video card can't do more than 1280x1024
DVI output. I _really_ don't want to be in the market for a new video
card too. Blech.)

Perhaps. But some of us find it more useful for reading reference matieral
while working on other stuff than advertising our qualities as mates. :)

Honestly, expect better from your users. :)

The argument for not supporting Xinerama that I can easily appreciate is
what it does to your code. Saying &quot;just don't use it&quot; isn't nearly as
compelling as &quot;it fuglifies the code&quot;.
