Wow. There's at least one person.

Back in the DOS days, packages were installed by extracting software 
in their own directories, where ever you wanted it, and removed by
deleting that directory. Simple, modular, and efficient. Even the
old days' Linux package management was a huge degradation compared
to that.

Of course, there were little in the way of dependencies in the DOS
world (and still in the Windows world, although not completely 
non-existent). Fortunately, there are now some packaging systems
based on relocatable binaries and application directories (such as
ZeroInstall), but these are still far from being widely used and
accepted, and still do need some work.

&gt;<i> Package maintainers have to deal with every single of these issues.
</I>&gt;<i> They have to take care of dependencies, versions and stuff. This is
</I>&gt;<i> why I have some sympathy with them and wouldn't label them as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dickheads&quot;. 
</I>
It seems very easy to cross the line of simply packaging software, 
into working on a silent fork.

&gt;<i> You can't just include every newest version of a piece of software as long
</I>&gt;<i> as you don't know the consequences. 
</I>
You is known, I do provide a &lt;<A HREF="http://iki.fi/tuomov/dl/ion-3-latest.tar.gz">http://iki.fi/tuomov/dl/ion-3-latest.tar.gz</A>&gt;
redirection, that distros could easily provide, to keep up-to-date. 
It is true that there are some problems, such as the set of files 
installed being modified, but these could be solved if the distros
more cooperative (and build systems better, so e.g. package management
programs obtain information by a structural build file). But presently
the distros are totally onconstructive. They don't want to give in an
inch from their position of power and control.

&gt;<i> Yes, there is a &quot;FOSS herd&quot;, and most of the time it makes me want to
</I>&gt;<i> cry. For me switching over to Windows is not an option, most windows
</I>&gt;<i> users are even less educated than OSS users.
</I>
Someone who knows they don't know is, however, less likely to be 
arrogant and hold Views, and therefore more easy for someone with
Views to work with, than someone with opposite Views.
