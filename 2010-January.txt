Subject: Moving workspaces
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1001141725070.9514@india.ece.cmu.edu>

I want to be able to move an entire workspace from one screen to
another. I tried (using the context menu), Workspace->Toggle Tag, and
then went to a new workspace in the other screen, and did
Workspace->Attach Tagged.

What did this is: it created a new floating workspace, put all my tiled,
tabbed windows from my original workspace into this new WGroupWS, and
then attached this WGroupWS to the other screen.

I'd hoped it would attach the tiling itself into the workspace on the
other screen.

Any ideas on how to do this?

Thank you!

There are no "tiled workspaces" anymore. Workspaces are "floating"
always, but may contain tilings. You moved the entire workspace,
so you got some mess.

You can do shit better with the primitives, instead of trying to
extend the tagging functionality beyond its design (as a simple
component of the default simple Ion way of doing things).
