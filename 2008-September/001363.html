<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; The second possibility is to implement a custom clientwin_do_manage_alt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hook and do all the work myself, at least for the windows that must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reside at nested workspaces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds better.

</I>&gt;<i> Although maybe the 'target' winprop should simply behave differently
</I>&gt;<i> by default.. it would be a small change.
</I>
I think a very flexible approach would be allowing cw groups to be
targets. This way arbitrarily complex layouts, including mplex indexes
and nested workspaces, could be setup, saved and restored, without
depending on a default positioning strategy. In fact that kind of
layouts are nowadays setup and saved, but never completely restored
because of the initial discarding of previous cw groups. Also the
ambiguity issue that motivated my question would disappear as target cw
and ws groups of interest are presumably leaf regions in the saved
layout (while frames aren't when there are nested ws around). I suppose
the problem is that cw groups are volatile regions that in the general
case aren't expected to persist from session to session. Maybe some of
them could be flagged sticky or something, so they are not discarded at
startup.

Anyway I've managed myself to get a quick hack working that allows
for specifying mx indexes, nested floating and tiled workspaces, unsets
initial activity alerts, plus a couple of other goodies that I'm not
able to remember now, all that from a clientwin_do_manage_alt hook. It's
indecent code that I'd rather keep for myself :), but it talks about the
extreme flexibility of ion.
