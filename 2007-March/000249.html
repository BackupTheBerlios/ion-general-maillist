They don't read any documentation. That's why you have to to throw
it on their faces... somehow the initial welcome messages of Ion
also seems to be ignored by many, however. But at least you won't
get new lusers complaining of old already resolved problems, or 
features that have changed significantly, if you provide them with
the latest version. People have already used a program for some 
time, would seem more likely to check if they have the latest, than
someone just installing it.

Unstable and testing are close enough.
