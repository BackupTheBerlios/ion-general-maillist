to view based on the package's 'main' binary, not the alias, which
is good. But then you do too much work, when you could just let man
do all the hard work, by passing it -M $implementation/man (which
could be a configurable location, like doc-dir). Here the use of -M
should be ok (cf. earlier posts on this thread), because we already
know that the manual page we want should be under that directory.

Of course, it would be nice to be able to view other manual pages
within the package as well, but that probably demands a much greater
overhaul of the man page and documentation systems...
