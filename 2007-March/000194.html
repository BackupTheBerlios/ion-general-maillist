I was just rereading this thread and that just clicked for me as well,
Most of the information I wanted to attribute is meta-data.  A few times
when I was thinking about this I was wondering who was going to bother
entering all this information and I'm still not sure.  One hierarchy can
be bad and I'm not entirely sure if several would be better.  I would
like to think it would though!

Yes, I think you are right here.  It would be a very powerful
organisational tool for this sort of thing, I can imagine some very good
interfaces based on this concept.  In terms of using it as a general
file system, I'm not sure how well it would scale (in human terms of
coming up with meaningful tags) past a few thousand objects/files.
