well, i read tuomovs rants as &quot;it was dropped because the
horror creeped into many areas of the code&quot; but i may be
mistaken.

i hope that the hack i proposed would be much less intrusive
and could get the job done at a minimum cost (both in terms of
lines of code and in terms of uglyness).

i imagine that the only changes needed would be to add
a &quot;create workspace hook&quot; and to make the placement of
floating windows &quot;virtual screen aware&quot;. ideally this
could all be done in lua but i haven't looked for the
necessary hooks, yet.

&gt;<i> Just for the record, I was also using ion3 until Xinerama support was

</I> 
agree'd. i have given up on using the gimp under ion a
long time ago, tho (prefer shotophop under vmware anyways).

but i think the fact that there are so few apps that benefit
from &quot;proper&quot; xinerama support only fuels my argument that
a comparably small hack might be good enough here
(think pareto principle).
