</I>but please don't blame the climate change on Xinerama. you are twisting
and bending your arguments in a remarkable, if not admirable way.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't want to to subscribe to a mailing list...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... because it's such a hassle to subscribe for just a single question.
</I>&gt;<i> I use slrn/NNTP/Gmane for most of my lists, BTW, and have disabled 
</I>&gt;<i> receiving the emails. I'd prefer not having to subscribe either, or
</I>&gt;<i> the subscription (and disabling of receiving mail) being queried
</I>&gt;<i> in response to a posting when not subscribed. (gmane, in fact, does
</I>&gt;<i> already try to verify that you really are there and not just a rooted
</I>&gt;<i> spam bot, before it lets you post... but the lists don't know that.)
</I>&gt;<i> It would also be great to be able to subscribe to just the single
</I>&gt;<i> thread that you start -- automatically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The less users, the better. Users are a problem...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - They are also the point of software - without them software is useless.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One user is enough. I don't need the zillion kids for whom Ion is the
</I>&gt;<i> latest shiny gadget to be dumped when the next one comes along.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Don't get me worng I still think ion is a great WM, but you seem to have a  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very odd mental block with regard to people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> People suck.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>it's starting to seem you might be one of them, actually. that's getting
ridiculous and/or annoying rapidly (accelatering at about 9.81 m/s^2: you are in
free fall). lucky thing, ion3 is more sensible and consistent than your
arguments and your general view of the state of affairs, which sound like some
of your neurotransmitters are off-balance right now. I've had enough of this
megalomaniac nonsense. so I'll stay away from this list from now on until I
have a ion3 related question (which then hopefully will not cause
pseudo-progressive comments from some kind of sociologist on crack).

no offense meant (not really),
