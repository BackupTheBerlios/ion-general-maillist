It looks as though Ted has shown you how to use INTERSECT, another
(hacky) option is:

  SELECT fileid
  FROM filetags
  WHERE tag IN ('foo', 'bar')
  GROUP BY fileid
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 2;

Efficient? I thought this was supposed to be an initial exploration of
the problem!  It'll be fine for a few thousand objects, but I really
don't know.

&gt;<i> Plus there's no 
</I>&gt;<i> structure for quick access to a known file name, which would seem

</I>
There's nothing in the database to check to see that the set of tags are
actually unique either.  I'd put a column in the files table and use a
trigger to keep it up to date.  You could put a unique constraint on the
key to make the database check that the key remains unique and use this
table to find the file associated with a key.

I've just written some code[1] for Postgres that should do everything
I've mentioned.  I've not played much with triggers before so if anyone
knows how to do it better let me know!

</I>
We all have to start somewhere!  Like all languages, it VERY good for
solving some problems in and crap at others.  It's a reasonable fit
here, but not perfect.
