<PRE>Hello! First off, thanks for making ion! it's great!

Something seems to be wrong with the query/ autocompletion part of
manpages (F1).  I can use F1 and then type the name (or other man commands)
and then i get a pager etc, but if i accidentally press tab no autocompletion
comes up, but alot of sed-processes get made and my computer gets very
slow!  they also don't seem to end (?) but killall sed fixes it.  I
couldn't find much info on what happens, but either pointers on where
to find more info or how to completely disable autocompletion for this
query would be cool!

I also have a litle question about scripting ion... how do i make a litle
script that opens a new workspace and sets up the correct windows (with
names for use with winprops) and then load the correct program? I read
some other mails on the list and found someone asking almost the same
question asking maybe he could use ioncore.read_safefile(). And he got
a reply he could use WMplex.attach() to set up his workspace (?). But
since the function-documentation is sometimes a bit cryptic i have a few
questions :)

- I think the best way to try at this is to use the lua-code command
  (mod+f3).  I can type in litle commands i know from the key-bindings
  i have, but i'm not sure how to use the WMPlex.attach function and
  usually get weird-ish errors if i try something. so where can i find
  some examples using read_safefile and/or attach?
- this is a bit stupid but how would i print the table returned by
  ioncore.readfile().  I tried something like this
  print(ioncore.readfile('saved_layout.lua')) but this just prints :
  'table: &lt;adress&gt;' and i don't know enough lua (yet!) to know how to
  work work with that :)

greets! jurjen
