<PRE>Hi there....

I had to rebuild my entire gentoo system during the weekend for a gcc
upgrade, to save ram and to prevent problems, I did most of it from the
console. after a few days, I was missing lots of X tools and since KDE and
everything was not totally done. I used ion3 which was already installed on
my system. In a few days, I got used to it very quickly and I must say I'm
loving it ;) and here I am on the mailing list ;)

I am very impress of how KDE applications are working well under ion3.
especially those with a dock (systray) icon. I had no idea they would
automatically fit in the corner of my screen.

I have two problems though.

Although KDE applications get trapped wonderfully in the doc. Skype, does
not. the icon isn't there and If I close the main window, I can't get it
back. I suppose that Skype use some unstandard way. but KDE supports it and
I believe Gnome has no problem with it either. I see this as a possible
improvement for ion3.

second, I use skim (kde frontend to scim) to type Japanese. it works fine
with all KDE application, but not in Firefox, or in Skype. but it works in
all apps under KDE. anything I could do to fix it? I mostly need to type
Japanese in these two applications. And I don't really want to switch input
system, as skim is working fantastically.

thanks and keep up your wonderful work.

oh, another question, how to I quit the wm with the keyboard? I did not find
a hotkey in the man page. right now, I go in the menu (F12) and I scroll
with the arrows through Session -&gt; Quit.

thanks

Mathieu
