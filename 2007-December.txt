I've checked that this release fixes the problem of floating windows
tagged with ``switchto = false`` taking focus when they pop under the
mouse pointer (see thread "Forbiding focus to floating window" of
November 19th).  Great!  Thanks for the good work.

Message-ID: <4754AB98.2010606@mail.ru>

Hi all.

Here is from docs:

Synopsis:
     ioncore.tabnum.show(frame, delay)
Description:
     Show tab numbers on frame, clearing them when submap grab is 
released the next time. If delay is given, in milliseconds, the numbers 
are not actually displayed until this time has passed.

Is there any trick to show tabnum always, not only in submap?

The display of tab numbers is controlled by a drawing engine attribute.
To toggle them, enter in Mod1+F3:

    _:set_grattr('numbered', 'toggle')

Also disable the tabnum binding to not have the attribute cleared.
If you want it automatically set, maybe some hook (e.g. the notify
one) is of help.

As far as I know, it's rather passive in the background after
the initial setup. So if it doesn't do any strange low-level
pointer management hacks, which it shouldn't need to, this
shouldn't be directly caused by that module. But check it
first and report back again, with a full backtrace.

I wasn't expecting you to want to have anything to do with said module ;-). I'll have to
get around to this tomorrow.

Segfaults are fixed no matter what triggers them -- even Gnome, if you
check the FAQ [1] -- unless, of course, the trigger itself has corrupted
Ion's data structures or so, which should be checked in case of modules
that have access to Ion's memory space.

HELO!

I can see line *scratchws* in the list of workspaces, meantime I don't
want to see it because I know that it exists.  Can I remove this line
from list?  I do not redefine any default settings of mod_sp, but the
line annoying me for a two or three last releases.  I tried to remove
all contents of ~/.ion3/default-session--0 and to start from scratch,
but the problem arose again.  BTW, when I upgraded ion3, I always just
install the new version without removing old one.  It sounds stupid, but
can it be the reason for configs to collide?

Message-ID: <100c84810712070054p14c441e4u51d0b7cd138c770f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Whenever I set the tab-bar style for my floating frames to

bar = "inside" or bar = "outside"

instead of shading, the float reduces in height and does not fully
collapse. Toggling shading again does not restore its original height.

This occurs on all windows though the Pidgin Buddy List seems to
toggle shading correctly, but not the conversation windows. It works
fine on all of my floats if I use the "shaped" bar style.

Also, what's the difference between the inside and outstyle bar styles?

Fixed (for next and hopefully final RC).

> Also, what's the difference between the inside and outstyle bar styles?

Whether the tab-bar is inside the border, or outside it. Whether you see
much of a difference depends on whether you have set a border.

No. The mod_sp.set_shown_on depends on those names.
You could write a custom F9 (I guess?) completor that
doesn't show it, but what's the big deal?

You should always start from a blank slate with development snapshots.
At the present RC stage thing should not (considerably) break, and at
the stable stage not at all (at least if the configs don't exploit some
bug...).

Nevermind yet, just an aesthetical whim. :)
This situation happens on my laptop, but on the desktop with (almost)
the same history of upgrading of ion3 and fully identical configs, the
*scratchws* line does not appears in the WS list.  The history of
upgrading on the desktop is more ancient.  Upgrade from previous release
(it named DS, am I right?) was not clean, as I wrote, but was done over
it.  Maybe some artifacts from last release or some other methaphysics
contaminated my ion's karma and it became doing things well, in my own
mean.  Maybe something like an even number of errors... :)

Best witches,
Evgeny

The scratchpad wasn't in its own group/ws earlier, but at some point
this was added for transient detach etc. However, old configs are not
modified until you destroy the existing scratchpad (by closing the
frame)) and toggle has to create a new one to display it.

This may just say I'm very very sad to see the ion-3 ports disapear from

I don't want blame anyone. I don't understand this law problem...I'just

Now I need to find something don't exist : another wm such good as ion3.

The only problem is some people wanting to interpret it the worst
possible way, although it would be trivial to comply with it.
Just a few small notices.. Of course, most people don't bother
to actually read the license before complaining and spreading
misinformation.

> Now I need to find something don't exist : another wm such good as ion3.

Just compile from source. It's not that difficult.

If there's demand, I could provide a relocatable binary as well...
Presently no ZeroInstall feed, though, because I can't build its
dependencies in Frisbee. But ZI is just a convenient way to install
a tarball with a relocatable binary.

Just like I said, I don't want blame anyone, maybe you right, maybe you
wrong, maybe FreeBSD ports manager right/wrong, I don't known. 

I'm not a developper (the more complex software I ever write is ?hello
world?), I'm not a ports maintener.

What I just want to say is I'm very regret there are no agreement between

Of course It's what I'm going to do (try), but the ports collection make all
dependency, and it's very fine technics. 

But the problem for me it's I'm not a programmer, I'm just a sysadmin, and
I think in some year when there lots of modification in all software I'm
not sure I can compile that. 

I'm just look in the old ports collection and there are very few patch in
the ion-3 ports, but maybe in few year they need more. I can only make very
few modifications.

I can answer that question, IMHO ion-3 is the best wm I ever seen (in
almost 20 years of unix). But all new users use some KDE/Gnome, this kind
of software let you have 3 finger very big by using the mouse.

Event I can't using ion-3 because I can build it I just want thanks you for
all this year with you software.

Regards.

Ion doesn't have many non-standard dependencies. Most systems have X11R6
libraries installed, of which no particular version is needed (aside from
bugs in some versions, in particular in relation to XGetTextProperty...).
Some libc related aspects need to be configured in system.mk (some systems
have some components sanely as separate, and others have monolithic libc),
but aside from that, the only non-standard dependency that needs
installation, is Lua. Lua is also quite easy to install: it has ANSI C
as its only dependency. (However, some versions of Lua's Makefiles set
broken permissions... But installing from ports or so may fix them.)

hi, 

accidentally, I just set up my first FreeBSD 
on a 500 MHz pentium III a few days ago (nice system, e.g. the short boot time
(booting was necessary quite some times before I got it right...). so I'm really
no freebsd expert. but I installed ion3 with

pkg_add -r ion-3ds

from the 6-stable/Latest branch:

Fetching
ftp://ftp3.de.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-6-stable/Latest/ion-3ds.tbz...

that's an old ion version (end of 2006) and tuomo probably will hate to see that
but better than nothing.

Hmm.. The Ion scripts repository might be one, in some way appropriate,
way to publish make scripts for various distros... Users would need
darcs or some custom scripts to download them, though. Unfortunately
there are no directory listings, so wget doesn't work from my site.
An index.html should take care of that, though.

tuomo,

I today learned 2 things:

a) ion3 has been removed from `macports' which is the MacOSX
package management system. in terms of  installed  base,  if
one  can  believe  available  statistics,  macos x is _much_
larger than all  the  other  *ixes  and  *uxes  together  --
actually  the  only  OS  besides  windows with a significant
number of installations (sure, how many mac  users  actually
install  x11-wms  -  or  other open source software for that
matter - is a different question). it's in this respect  not
a peripheral platform.

b)  debian  seems to distribute now ion3 under some nonsense
name (particelMan?)  in order to adhere to your  licence  (I
was'nt aware of this naming aspect, actually).

you sure, that that's what you want for `ion3'. some kind of
name aliasing tricks for the only reason that  your  license
calls  for  such  things?  which  does prevent exactly what?
which does have exactly what benfits?

I  think  it really would be a wise and nice thing to do and
draw a line at demanding some unambigous info in the package
that  it's none of your buiseness if an old version does not
work  as  expected.  enforcing  "under   cover"   names   is
ridiculous.

otherwise  this  seems  a sure strategy to finish `ion3' off
outside of a _very_ small group. I'm sure you would'nt  care
but need you enforce such a thing?

joerg

This distros are mostly composed of ridiculuous fuckwits and 
dickheads -- ex school bullies who can only package and corrupt
others' software -- if even that -- and not actually write new
software, let alone something that wouldn't be a clone (the whole
FOSS movement is incapable of that). They consider it "unreasonable"
and impossible to add prominent notices that I will have nothing 
to do with their obsolete and modified shit. Renaming is the 
alternative to that.

I don't want to have anything to do with the typical specimen of 
the FOSS herd. I rather deal with a handful of nice and intelligent
people.

Dear Tuomo, Dear Joerg

Yes, may I just express exactly the same. Over the past few months I have
installed ion3 without even the slightest of minimal hassles on quite a
number of mac os x's using macports. Now, it's gone and I already am having
trouble, having to go through dependencies etc.

Ion is an extremely useful tool, and me and several in my lab now use it
effectively. However, we don't want to have to spend a day or more every
time we want to reinstall it on some new machine, hunting for dependencies
etc. In particular, that'll make sure we *NEVER* update to a newer version
if we have a working one... in fact, that's what happened to me before... I
stuck with ion1 for ages just because I got all kinds of silly problems
compiling it.

Thus, from my view and people like me, ion not being available on
repositories like macports will just make sure we stick with an even older
version than what we would if we were to stick with the ones on the
repositories... so seems very counterproductive...

Best wishes,
Quentin

PS: and as we're here: This is what I get when trying to compile:

ql:~/Desktop/ion-3rc-20071130% make

This file belongs to the glibc (or libc and I don't know its name in

At least in linux, libintl.c is in libc6-dev. Install that package and 
that error should go away.

I installed ion3 from the official RC on an ubuntu server I use in my 
notebook (so that I didnt have to deal with gnome from the start) and 
when compiling it, I found a lot of missing dependencies and errors, 
however they were not hard to track and fix.
I guess if you guys wanna give it a try from the source, if you face 
errors you can post them here. At least I don't mind helping out with them.

Saludos.

Some systems may need a separate libintl package installed, as it
cleanly isn't part of a single monolith. In that case, also enable
the EXTRA_LIBS += -lintl line from system.mk .

Note that system.mk has been quite stable for very long, so it is
recommended that you store it for future use. Then you only have
to copy it over when upgrading.

Not to say that the Ion package maintainers (in the cases
that the term can be applied) are among this crowd. But they,
like Ion users, are in a minority that is not large enough to 
set policy. The herd, many among which would happily see choice
like Ion disappear from the face of the planet, can do so.

Really - You think that's good?
I really do question your sanity at times, more recently than ever before.  
You have written, and published, a pretty decent WM, but don't seem to  
want anyone to benefit from it.

Simply adding the message you want to the top of the ion man page, and  
that "informational" window that you get first time you run ion really  
ought to be enough to say "this package may not be the latest available -  
check tuomo's site". TBH - I'd not care if that popped up every time I ran  
ion (once every 6 months or so, whenever I have a power cut).

So anyone who doesn't spend all their time recompiling software for what  
is, for most people, a tool and nothing more, is an idiot according to you.
Well, I almost exclusively use binary packages - because they make my life  
easier.  And yes I expect them ALL to behave the same way. If you're  
writing a distro then that level of consistency in your package management  
is important. Adding prominent messages to ion (the program, not a special  
case in the package handler) is much easier.  People who hate it strongly  
enough can simply compile it out if they want (or you could add a config  
option) - package maintainers won't bother.

You'd rather deal with yourself and only yourself - you've demonstrated  
this arrogance before, and will do again.  It's a shame that I don't have  
the time to write a tiling WM myself, because I actually think that a  
couple of us here could do a very good job of it.

People read manual pages? Those people that install Ion from a distro
without checking whether it is obsolete?

Bah, the distros conduct is the problem, so they should fix it.

And besides, then I'd have to forbid the distros from removing that -- 
and again they would moan that "it's not free". (The FSF is actually 
among the saner end of the FOSS movement, what with GFDL including 
invariant sections, and GPLv3 containing provisions for requiring 
modified versions to be renamed or so. The real zealots are centered
around the distros, and only consider those licenses "free" that give
distros the most power at the expense of authors.)

It's funny, actually: FOSS is supposed to be developed in a bazaar, 
but the typical FOSS licenses are only suited for cathedral mode of 
development: release when it is ready and stable as a rock. For 
otherwise you'll have to suffer from distros distributing obsolete
development snapshots.

These are not end-users with other specialities, but rather the lower
strata of developers.

I provide one too -- for a few platforms. Most authors provide them on 
Windows. But generally binary packages for FOSS operating systems are only
available from The Party.

I've had enough of the FOSS herd, and how it's destroying everything I
once thought could be great. I really am universes distant from them.

Yep, the typical FOSS attitude: write a clone for petty reasons of 
ideology, rather than fixing far bigger issues with the shoddy quality
of FOSS crap, the monoculturist practises prevalent in the movement,
ridding yourself of the love of The Party, and so on.

Bullshit. They e.g. include patches and modules I will not have anything
to do with, in the Ion package itself, instead of separately. That's not
just "making life easier", it's being a dickhead. Removing a startup message
could be seen as "making life easier", although it really is a dickhead
action.

> Most development should be cathedral style, with a bazzar as "unstable".   

The distros take the bazaar unstable snapshots of software, and fraudulently
provide them as "stable" in their megafrozen cathedrals.

> My work machine must "just work"(TM) I don't have time to fiddle with it

The distros don't deliver. FOSS doesn't deliver. I don't have the time
to fix fonts on every upgrade, and yet FOSS keeps becoming more and more
AA/XML-fascist. I don't have the time for configuring udev brain damage
to my needs. And I don't have the time to compile software when distros
provide old and broken versions, instead of recent ones.

> Yes - because "The Party" is the best placed to package them in a

And this purported "consistency" comes at an expense of forming a few
powerful central parties that oppress authors -- and soon users too. 
There can not be that many distros with considerable package collections.
Consequently power is centralised in their hands. They become the
gatekeepers of software available to users. Microsoft has less power 
over the software users use on Windows, than the biggest distros over 
the software people use on Linux.

"They" were right about the comm^Wcollectivist nature of FOSS, although
on wrong grounds.

Copyright was originally purportedly created to protect authors from
publishers -- the filty capitalists. In practise the publishers use
it against both users and authors, who have to hand over the copyright
to get access to the publishing channels they control.

Copyleft was purportedly created to, well, protect software from those
filthy capitalists. In practise copyleft licenses just hand over power
from authors to another set of publishers -- the free software Party.

That's (copy)right and (copy)left for you. Two faces of the same coin.

If flexible dynamically extensible and non-monoculturist software is 
the "one true way", then so be it. For the FOSS herd, Party control,
huge monoliths, anti-aliasing, udev, UTF-8, WIMP, etc. are the one 
true way.

> I'd also love to see a WM that encouragees it's users to contribute back,  

Ion is modular. But the moronic FOSS herd does not like modular code:
it wants the original author to maintain their shoddy patches that he
does not care about. That is, once again they want the authors to be
their slave, just like the distros do.

tuomo,

everything  has (again) be said often enough, but I try it a
last time.  up to now I gave you  the  credit  of  having  a
(minor)  point  and  thus a bit of justification for causing
this trouble. but stepping back a bit and trying to  analyse
your reasoning shows that it's altogether off-the-wall.

the  problem  is  that  you  WANT  something  and then argue
backwards  to  construct  reasons  for   your   intransigent
attitude.  and  excessive  albeit  sometimes creative use of
four letter words is  nothing  but  replacing  arguments  by
shouting.

so,  yes:  people  do  read  manpages. and john is of course
right, that such a modification to the manpage or  something
similar  would suffice to make your sole point: tuomo (if no
one else) considers anything older  than  4  weeks  obsolete
crab.

regularly,  at  this point, you twist it along the same line
of "reasoning": users  too  dumb/lazy  to  understand  this,
therefore  I need more'. tell you what, you'll never achieve
a state where 100% of the people get the message. but  maybe
90%     would   really   be  enough.  moreover,  your  whole
supposition that users will complain in large numbers  seems
wrong  to me. how much traffic is there on the mailing list?
what if you ignore mails which violate  your  high  standard
("current version or nothing")?

but  that  does  not  satisfy  you.  somehow you need "them"
crawling in the dust. so this "fight"  is  not  about  users
coming  to  you  (how  do  they  do this? I only know of the
mailing list -- it's  that  difficult  _not_  to  answer  if
someone asks for help with a 12 month old ion3 version?) and
demanding help (nobody _demands_ it), it's about  some  kind
of  crusade  (the  historic as well as the contemporary ones
have been notoriously successful endeavours).

the  only  thing  you  achieve  is  the annihilation of time
resources all over the place, your own included  (by  futile
mail  discussions,  by  the  trouble in the repositories, by
problems with compiling it yourself).

and  defining  the  distros as the evil empire -- yeah sure,
they have the bomb, too.

so  I think you are addressing more or less only 2 different
points:

1. users thick as a brick. therefore must enforce my message
with draconic measures.

2. distros evil. therefore must fight them.

after   the   fight:  nothing  works  any  longer.   mission
accomplished.

and,  finally,  after  reading the last posts: it seems that
ion3 has quite some dependencies which still  cause  trouble
in  the  build  process.  I  only  know of a single wm which
really compiles out of the box without _any_  trouble:  dwm.
I  don't  think  the  much larger/complexer ion3 can achieve
this -- that's why all the distros  are  there  and  do  the
patching and tweaking. and so on and so on.

so, altogether, I think your goals for ion3 are ill-defined:
make up your  mind  if  you  want  that  it  is  used  in  a
significant  number  of  installations.  if  so, accept that
`ion3' might be mutating a bit in some distros (mostly  this
won't  happen  at  all)  or  that it will exist in different
versions concurrently. no problem at all, except if you have
a  weird  sense  of property and are a control freak. or has
ion3 become simply a means of fighting the evil  empire  for
you?

without  the  fighting the situation would be as it has been
for some years: ion3 available and usable. everybody  happy.
nobody corrupting your work in any real way.

if  you  don't  want  that  it's used, burn it, for heaven's
sake. this would be at least a quicker  and  more  efficient
procedure in comparison to what's going on right now.

distribution of Ion.

It doesn't. It has to be slammed on the users' faces. Maybe
that way 90% will get the message. Without it, maybe 10% gets
it.

Well, the FOSS herd is on a crusade against software they don't
consider "free", and don't care if choice and quality in software
disappears in the process of world domination by software with 
licenses acceptable to them.

Nothing works ATM or in the past either. Distro release quality
control is a fucking joke. They just throw development snapshots
of marginal software in, and freeze them, expecting the authors
to deal with that.

I don't want to have anything to do with the FOSS herd and where
it's heading with its cherished software. That's why I'm switching
to Windows when it's time to upgrade.

> without  the  fighting the situation would be as it has been

Hardly. Most likely corrupted to use Xft, and thus not offering
usable fonts.

Seriously, the right place to put a "don't cry if you aren't bleeding

Are you talking about Xinerama support here? - the mod which works fine,  
doesn't cause probles on non Xineramra desktops but you have some bizarre  
notion is amoral on some grounds I've never quite grasped?

Not in my experience with ion on various distros, obscure bugs will always  
exist - and unless you provide stable branches what is a maintainer meant  
to to? The path of least resistance is to take the latest release and test  
it for a while, then release it if it's stable on their box(es).  As you  
don't maintain a "stable" branch they can't rely on you to fix a bug  
without introducing more in line with some shiny new feature that you're  
preparing for.
So the correct solution here is for you to maintain two branches - Stable  
and devel. Fix bugs in stable and make a new stable branch every so often  
when there is a feature set you're happy to release (and consider feature  
complete and stable). Then abandon the old stable.
How hard can a single integrate be when a bug is found? Then the cathedral  
engineers can be confident in what they are using, and you get a limited  
set of code to support, which was your original complaint IIRC.

I really don't know what your problem is with AA or udev: Correctly done  
AA actually helps text (although it's not always available), udev doesn't  
exactly kick up a stink.  My machine "just works" (TM).
I only check the version of running software when I'm looking for a  
particular feature, or about to go and search online docs / ask for advice.

Ah - you're feeling opressed.  Then again you seem to feel victimised by  
most walks of life if your blog is anything to go by. I think that's  
mostly how you view the world.

non-monoculturist? So you'll support xinerama, anti aliasing, udev now  
will you? Rather than declaring them all to be anti-tuomo.

So you're unable to take a shoddy patch and apply the correct fix to your  
own code? That seems pretty feeble

Utter and total BULLSHIT. Ion2 is the stable branch. But the idiots
behind the distros think they know better than the author, which
releases are stable -- meaning bug-free, not "static" as the distros
apply the term.

AA makes text ugly, blurry, and unreadable, compared to decent unblurred
screen fonts. It only helps with shoddy printer fonts--which are no good
without hinting on present poor screen resolutions. But the herd just
loves anti-aliasing and all other new/modern shine, and expects everyone
else to do so too, and crams it down their eyes.

Try adjusting device permissions, symlink names, anything. It's pain
compared to just chmod/chown/ln -s. The cryptic config files also
change all the time in the distros, and it takes ages at boot. 
(Its designed hac a complete lack of understanding of the fundamentals 
of computer science, doing a linear search for the correct rules by 
executing 10000 lines of shell scripts, instead of constructing 
appropriate search trees.)

It's more work for me to maintain all that code. The FOSS herd has not
yet grasped the two fundamental principles of maintainable software:
modularity and abstraction (cf. abstract wchar_t and locale encoding
vs. hard-coded UTF-8.)

Not so much anymore... The 2005-something snapsnot in the previous
static Debian was generating a lot of traffic.

For the yet earlier "static", IIRC the maintainer actually cared
to ask whether I think the development version of Ion should go in
there, but after that stopped doing that. They've become too big 
and powerful, and obviously all courtesy has gone down the drain
along with that.

There it is: usable means: the herd likes it. That's not monoculturist?

Hi there,

guys, I don't think that this discussion will lead anywhere.
A few days ago, when ion3 was removed from the FreeBSDs ports system I
was quite angry and looking for an alternative.  There are several
tiling WMs available, but none of them is a good replacement for ion3.
So I'll stay with ion3 and continue reading this mailing list.

On the freebsd-ports mailing list I stated that I can understand some
of Tuomos opinions, and I'm ready to give more details: I started
using Linux back in the days as the 486 systems slowly where replaced
with the first generation of pentiums. Back in these days
installations where done with CDs and Diskettes were still widely in
use. Packaging was done by extracting tarballs in the root directory.
In these days people dreamed about replacing Windows. They were happy
that their Linux installation was smaller than any Windows setup.

Several years later things changed dramatically: Most Linux
installations are bigger than everything Microsoft installs. Instead
of designing something good and new people started to copy Windows
just make it more easy for non Linux-users to migrate.
You can select between Gnome, KDE and Xcfe, and all try to do the
same. Users want applications that help them solving a problem. But
now you have  KDE-App that is better than everything found in Gnome
and vice versa. So you'll end up having all Libs and dependancies
installed anyway. Great...

When someone is using an Unix for the first time he/she complains that
things are different than on Linux. I'm beyond the point to discuss
such stupidity, I just want to slap them in the face. Most people
don't even want to know why things are handled differently and just
states that "Linux is better" - without even knowing the technical
background of a solution.

So Linux created some kind of standard because people started to
develop _for Linux_ and not Open Source in general. This led to
strange effects where Unices are said to behave wrongly or are even
buggy due to their own implenentation of a library/function
call/whatever. Libiconv is a nice example for this.
So when you open a problem record for a tool because you've problems
on Solaris for example you find your problem being closed without
solution because the problem is the target OS. Nice.
On the other hand if there is something wrong with a program users are
being told to fix it themselves because they have the code. What a
chizophrenia! Most users aren't developers, and most developers aren't
even good at what they are doing. I wouldn't want any user with
limited coding abilities to fidle around with some source code.
But exactly those users is being told that it is save to switch over
to Linux instead of Mac OS X. Yeah, I see...

So yes, "Modern technology mostly sucks." puts it in good terms. This
is correct for most Hardware related things, too. Look at USB, the
protocol just sucks because of it's overhead. But you find it
everywhere.

I dropped Linux two years ago after many annoyances with the kernel
and related software. If you're not on the mainstream road but like
something else (PowerPC, for example), you're doomed. Patches are
blocked upstream or even removed after it's clear they break something
x86-related. Which is just possible because something is broken in x86
anway. But instead of fixing the x86 parts the PowerPC patches were
removed. Great...
BTW: Linus Torvalds said a few month ago that Linux drivers are
working "good enough". What the hell does this mean? It means in the
end that these drivers don't work in 100% of all possible
configurations. And this means that some users have to play with
something else.

This had side effects on all distributions, of course. If you want to
make it easy for all users to work with Linux, you have to take
everything into account. So it doesn't matter if a workstation needs
20 seconds to boot up, or 120.

Package maintainers have to deal with every single of these issues.
They have to take care of dependencies, versions and stuff. This is
why I have some sympathy with them and wouldn't label them as
"dickheads". I'm happy when I've a package at hand that I can use. The
FreeBSD ports system was exactly what I was looking for. I dropped
Debian because of issues with their ports system, and Gentoos emerge
was just too slow, and fiddling around with masked packages is awfull.
I guess that every package systems has its pros and cons, because it
has to be compromise between the package and the distribution. You
can't just include every newest version of a piece of software as long
as you don't know the consequences. On the other hand some packages
have too many changes/patches applied (found this on Debian where
several packages have nothing in common with the default).

Yes, there is a "FOSS herd", and most of the time it makes me want to
cry. For me switching over to Windows is not an option, most windows
users are even less educated than OSS users.

BTW: Some people state that AntiAliasing is bad for the eyes since the
font appears to be blurred it's stressfull to look at since the eyes
try to get it properly focused. At least it adds up to the fact why
eyes are getting tired infront of the screen...

So where's the problem - it appears to have gone away.  Of course you also  
have a morbid fear of forums, which are what the majority of "new" users  
seem to expect/want to see.

That's not what I said, at least it's not what I thought I'd said.

You're attitude to most things that you don't like is to be rude, AA has  
been subject to your wrath for a while now. Xinerama was subject your  
wrath - until you lost the plot and ripped support out entirely.

I'm sorry I thought I was talking to a rational individual.  Morality is,  
at worst, a societal decree of acceptable behaviour, and at best a clear  
definition of correct behaviour provided by the designer of a system.
I'm guessing you're agnostic since you seem to detest religion so much.

ugly - subjective
blurry - subjective and dependant on the antialiasing used
unreadable - subjective
You (as admitted below) just hate anything new.

Never causes me any issues - on personal machines or any of the servers  
(both in office servers and the ~hundred public facing servers we run).
Cryptic config is a pain wherever it is, but it's not as if the ion config  
file is stable in syntax.

Before I removed the support (and a while after it), there were people very
frequently complaining how focus in Xinerama is broken, how positioning of
floating frames is broken, and so on. I have better things to use my time
on than explaining things to those planet-wrecking conspicious consumers,
or trying to fix a feature I'd have hard time testing. (I _do_ have my
hypothetical 20-year-old telly[*] as a second screen in X, but none of 
this Xinerama crap, and switching to Xinerama and maintaining a second 
configuration is too much trouble.)

---

[*] Soon the computer -- or rather, $torrent-tracker-of-choice -- will be 
its only image source, as the planet-wrecking government and TV companies 
will be shutting down analogue transmissions on cable too. I have on plans
of getting additional unusable (to the power of n) electronic junk to convert
a digital signal to analogue. The DigiTV transition in Finland is an ecological 
and usability disaster. Forcing people (who want to watch that crap on TV)
to buy _temporary_ electronic junk before their old TVs die of age, and 
they'd get new ones with in-built digital receivers... not to even speak
of the brain damage of not going straight with HDTV. DigiTV was originally
a plan for a centralised poor man's internet, but those plans of long ago
been abandoned, and now they're just sending the same old signal in digital
form.. and luring people into pay-tv. Now, for terrestrial transmissions 
there may be very good reasons for freeing up the bandwidth, but in cable 
there's plenty to share.

I'm just godless. (Good you didn't think of me as an atheist.)

Speaking of which, I recently watched the latest diatribe by Richard
Dawkins and, well, that guy chants "Science and Reason" more frequently
and with more fervor than US propaganda goes on about "Freedom and
Democracy".

Subjectivity is the key. But the practises of the FOSS herd do not
support subjective tastes.

You're talking about software in development stage. Now, of course, the 
distros where it changes are also in development, which brings as back to
topic: the software in the megafrozen ("stable") is too old and too broken
to be of much use, so you have to use their even more broken development
versions. (Which, from what I call, even the "stable" releases of many
more frequently-snapshotted distros are.)

Which means: a separate module, so I don't have to care about it. I don't
like having to wait weeks when trying to make a release, to see if the 
contributors have gone AWOL, will have time upgrading their (such as
autocrap), and so on. And I'm not going to start upgrading/fixing 
features I don't care for.

Back in the DOS days, packages were installed by extracting software 
in their own directories, where ever you wanted it, and removed by
deleting that directory. Simple, modular, and efficient. Even the
old days' Linux package management was a huge degradation compared
to that.

Of course, there were little in the way of dependencies in the DOS
world (and still in the Windows world, although not completely 
non-existent). Fortunately, there are now some packaging systems
based on relocatable binaries and application directories (such as
ZeroInstall), but these are still far from being widely used and
accepted, and still do need some work.

It seems very easy to cross the line of simply packaging software, 
into working on a silent fork.

You is known, I do provide a <http://iki.fi/tuomov/dl/ion-3-latest.tar.gz>
redirection, that distros could easily provide, to keep up-to-date. 
It is true that there are some problems, such as the set of files 
installed being modified, but these could be solved if the distros
more cooperative (and build systems better, so e.g. package management
programs obtain information by a structural build file). But presently

Someone who knows they don't know is, however, less likely to be 
arrogant and hold Views, and therefore more easy for someone with
Views to work with, than someone with opposite Views.

Yes I feel that floating windows are rather counter to the concept of ion

Although my applications are anything but well behaved.  Fortunately  
vncviewer (the worst culprit in my mind) finds it hard to jump across the  
screens (even under xinerama) so stays jumping to the last selected frame  
on the one screen, allowing me to work on this one :)

Atheism is a faith position - you seemed to eschew that vehemently, but at  
least you're consistent. (even if you are wrong ;-p )

Ah - the athiest who claims he has no faith. He chants most things more  
frequently than anyone - he's probably figured out that he is in a faith  
position and can't work out how to back down... </off topic>

Of course not - though shalt be clones.
Seriously - I agree with you, but as the whole thing doesn't support  
abstractions of context from presentation we have to work with what we  
have (unless you want to fork/reimplement the whole shooting match) That's  
one of the problems with any long project.  Abstraction is easy in short  
term tightly defined projects.
Or with hindsight.
But by then it's expensive.

Yep - if the last "stable" release you made was over three years ago.
There is a balance to be had between stability and frequency.  I've never  
installed ion2, because I'd never actually seen it.  I spotted ion3 on a  
colleagues screen and asked what it was.
I've not gone back, because ion3 is actually pretty stable - for  
everything I do. I can't imagine there are many situations where it's  
horribly unstable/unusable, and for those ion2 may well cater.
You then get the opportunity for more testing and feedback on potential  
useful features.

Or, you could just tell these users to fuck off and not provide support.
Seems like a better choice than putting up a license no one can accept
which will just make your software less accessible to everyone.

I understand the point of what you're doing, but the insanity if what
you've done outweighs any real wins for the users. If you don't want
people to have access to your software, 'rm' is pretty simple. A
retarded license is not.

Why put years of work into software only to close development and attach
an outrageous license? Do you really hate people that much? Do you hate
yourself that much?

If your goal is to thin out the size of the ion user pool, then you'll
achieve it through this license. Don't mistake this email for me trying
to change your mind, because that's a waste of time.

That's the FOSS herd's cherished worse-is-better fallacy for 
you. Once the shoddy quick&dirty solution is popular, it is 
difficult/expensive to fix it. If people only would stop to
think and ask for input before embarking on writing crap.

Don't get me wrong, worse-is-better is quite ok for some
projects, mostly marginal ones, and to which it is feasible
write many alternatives to. Ion development pretty much follows
that approach, and Ion is not particular beautiful code, although
there are some aspects I like. But essential core software, of 
which There Can Be Only One (in practise), demands different 
standards -- far higher standards.

> Yep - if the last "stable" release you made was over three years ago.

Sorry I don't have infinite amounts of time for working on Ion,
unlike the paid developers of the more popular projects that are
turning Linux/FOSS into a steamping shitpile.

There are some pretty bad bugs/omissions even in the latest 
release. Comes from working on the code very intermittently.

I thought I only had bad humour. Well, one does occasionally make

So, is there any interest in providing the files this way?
If there is, then create, say, build/$OS directory, with a 
suitable index.html listing the files (so e.g. wget works),
and maybe containing instructions. Then use darcs to send 
the stuff.

if  you  say  so... maybe right w.r.t. dependencies on libs.
otherwise:

I  tried it again with yesterday's version and I should have
known better: trying to compile ion3 "manually" under MacOSX
is  a  nightmare  for  anybody  not  up  to his waist in the
internals of gcc and differences introduced by apple.

is  there  *anbody*  out  there  able  to  compile  it under
macos???

I gave up (again...). problems (to the extent that they have
surfaced) are related to several gcc/ld flags not  available
under MacOS:

-shared
-whole-archive
-export-dynamic

and  librt:  is  that  supposedly  a  standard lib? it's not
there.

tuomo,  man, get a hold of yourself (or, rather, the licence
text), so that it is again sufficient that _one_ guy  solves
it  _once_  and  puts in back in the repository. it can't be
that much fun to see users suffer. or can it? I,  at  least,
am fed up with trying. that's no longer a manageble average-
user task.

and,  of  course,  if  in  the  end it were possible to find
makefiles and/or system.mk  versions  on  your  side,  it'll
help.  but  I'm  at  least  obviously  not  in a position to
contribute  these  for  MacOSX.  (and  it  only   seems   an
unnecessary  complication  in comparison to having it in the
repositories. but I suspect your attitude is uncorrectable.)

system.mk:

#PRELOAD_MODULES=1

That one option takes care of all that.

EXTRA_LIBS += -lrt

(I suppose this could be better explained..)

Disable that, and if the MacOS X isn't totally brain-damaged,
things should work (aside from setting the system clock confusing
Ion's timers, if the POSIX monotonic clock isn't available through
libc directly or so. But that's just an annoyance that was only
recently fixed with support for the monotonic clock, where
available).

...

See, it's not so difficult, once you get rid of the autocrap
mindset. Of course, I'd also prefer not having to edit a file
to compile a program, but this is still better than the autocrap
solution.

Also, if people reported more complex settings required for 
particular systems back upstream, instead of just working on
their silent forks, things would be easier. But in the Distro
Code Of Conduct, it's forbidden to have any contact with
authors.

And it looks to me as Tuomo is being vindicated :)

Kidding aside, it goes beyond the "FOSS herd's attitude."

Shall I, more generally, recommend reading the book--among those fundamentals
ones to have opened once in life--and classic, How to Solve It, by George
Polya?

If you are keen to improve your problem solving skills, and don't know the
book yet, this is a HIGHLY suggested reading.

George Polya has been a professor in Mathematics but don't fear.

Similarly to Karl Marx, who [correctly, eventually ... and in a sense--Marx
was humorously exaggerating a bit of course] has remarked that even a child
would be able to understand and follow the logic of his *Das Kapital*, a work,
nota bene, among the most important achievements of humanity [Louis Althusser:
das Kapital has opened to mankind the *continent* of the SCIENTIFIC study of
history and related disciplines nothing less], George Polya could have stated
that no other mathematical knowledge beyond an elementary one is required to
understand How to Solve It. (Well, maybe Polya has said that too.)

In short, the book, How to Solve It, is focused on understanding problems,
devising and carrying out plans, checking the answers. And the strategies
practiced in it could even help you in--example--ordering pizza in New York,
eventually. (Ordering pizza more effectively, I mean.)

Anyway: please, please, PLEASE ... Tuomo, stick with system.mk!

Cheers,

Hi all

One question (not for the license) about ion.

When I press ?F1? and ?TAB? to have the list of my workspace I've got
*scratchws*. 

How can I exclude *scratchw* from this list ? I don't say I don't want this
but I use it with ?Alt+space? and don't need it in F1. 

Thanks.

NB:If this is a bug and don't exist in <28 day version, just tell me. Don't
need a thread for that.

There was a thread about three weeks ago titled "Annoying title in the WS

Message-ID: <20071225221055.GA21478@localhost>

Hey, I'm just going to throw this out here to see if I have any fellow
sufferers, and to hopefully get some tips on efficiently debugging the problem.

I am running Debian unstable on a Thinkpad R51. Debian is updated and upgraded.
Ion is 3rc-20071220. However, I also had this problem on Debian testing and some
unknown ion snapshot. And before that, I had it with Debian's packaged ion3, but
now we're getting into ancient history. The point is, this problem has persisted
over multiple versions and a couple fresh installs of operating systems. (But
always on the same laptop. I installed ion3 on Cygwin[1] and it works fine, iirc.)

The problem is that I can't type into queries. Well, let me refine that. First,
I can open queries with F3, F4, etc. no problem. Further, tab works. Arrow keys
work. Backspace even works! But alphanumerics do not.

Like I said, I'm just throwing this out there. I haven't done any debugging at
all. I just wanted to see if I suffer alone.

You messed something up. There's no groupedpholder at all anymore.

You can also switch to other workspaces with Mod1+1..0. By that logic,
they should not be in F9 either?

No, there's no simple way to filter it out, and there won't be (aside
from any custom scripts you or someone writes). It's a workspace/group
just like any other, and demands no special case handling.

This is a mystery problem that people now and then complain about, but
nobody can provide hard evidence. Maybe it's some X locale support 
fuckup, with XmbLookupString failing to translate keystrokes into
strings. Or maybe it's libc locale fuckup, causing the control character
filter to fail. Try messing with insstr in ioncore/key.c, to see what 
happens. Try to see what xev prints.

Should be ok now. Must've made the signature while the tarball was still

I've attached my system.mk and make's output. I can get around this
error by taking out gettext, but it would be cool to figure it out.

I have no clue, personally. The libtu.a compiles just fine, and -lintl
is clearly in the gcc command line, in front of -llibtu.

This is the standard GCC/*nix linker brain damage: you have to have
the libs meticulouslu ordered on the command line. It wants -lintl
after -ltu. Trying to arrange for that is pain. gcc/ld sucks.

It may help to change the order of LIBS and EXTRA_LIBS in LDFLAGS in
system.mk. But it may break something else.

Subject: Nagware version
Message-ID: <20071229152546.GA22341@jolt.modeemi.cs.tut.fi>

I've been considering releasing (as a patch) a separate nagware version
of Ion, which would have a license without the 28-day clause. The patch 
is included as a draft (without any accompanied permission yet to treat
it as an insignificant change). Presently it checks the latest release
redirection [1] every 28 days. An annoying call-home feature, I know,
which would not be featured in the standard release (including my
ZeroInstall feed). As is apparent from the README changes, the patch
requires luacurl [2]. Discuss it if you want. I however doubt that the
unconstructive distros motivated by ideology and maintaining their own
power, would accept even that, although the resulting license should be
"free" (and would be GPLv3 compatible, if based on it intead of LGPLv2.1).
And yet, the package management system is the right place for this kind 
of features, not programs themselves (reinventing a half-assed package 
management system).

Given GPLv3, any distro could take it out too, so you'd be relying on
the cooperation of maintainers (whom you already consider
uncooperative or you wouldn't be trying this, right?) Or am I missing
some licensing language (that wouldn't meet the DFSG, if it
*prevented* people from removing the code, rather than merely asking...)

Hmm, what would that look like as a package management feature? just
"new version available" (like synaptic does - if you provided your own
repository you'd have that now) or do you mean just complaining to the
end user that "these packages are stale"?

GPLv3 includes provisions for additional terms that may require modified
versions to be renamed, etc. [1, Section 7, c & e]. Programs covered by 
such additional terms (as listed in Section 7) and GPLv3 remain compatible
with other GPLv3 software (which may also contain additional terms as
listed in Section 7), while those additional terms become viral. 

That's my IANAL reading of it anyway. If to not keep a limited set
of additional terms compatible with GPLv3 codebase, why include such
provisions at all in the license?

Actually GPLv3, does already in Section 5 state that "The work must carry
prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant
date", which might even be enough, but is up to interpretation. GPLv2
idiotically only required source files to carry notices, but few end
users ever see them.

In the case of distros not keeping up-to-date, just complaining to 
the user trying to install or upgrade a package, that the version 
available is not in sync with author, and author may not support it.
This would be a very useful service for all software, not just for
complying with the Ion license. 

But more generally, of course, a package management system could
automatically keep watch on packages being updated, and notify the
user.

Sorry for the repeat posting--I seem to have lost the thread, so am replying
to this one.

I'm also trying to compile ion on macosx, and not managing. As Joerg, I'd
really like there to be some repository where I can get it as a binary...

Anyway, while that' s not looking likely I'm enjoying running after
dependencies. When I run make, I get the following:

set -e; for i in libtu libextl libmainloop mod_tiling mod_query mod_menu
mod_dock mod_sp mod_sm mod_statusbar de ioncore ion pwm etc utils man po ;
do make -C $i; done
gcc -Os -W -Wimplicit -Wreturn-type -Wswitch -Wcomment -Wtrigraphs -Wformat
-Wchar-subscripts -Wparentheses -pedantic -Wuninitialized
-DCF_XFREE86_TEXTPROP_BUG_WORKAROUND -DHAVE_SNPRINTF      -c output.c -o
output.o
In file included from output.c:23:
private.h:15:21: error: libintl.h: No such file or directory
output.c: In function 'fallback_warn':
output.c:116: warning: implicit declaration of function 'dgettext'
output.c:116: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in
function 'dgettext'
make[1]: *** [output.o] Error 1
make: *** [subdirs] Error 2

I don't really understand why it doesn't find libintl.h. When I run locate
libintl.h I get:

/opt/local/include/libintl.h
/opt/local/var/macports/build/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_ports_cross_avr-gcc/work/build/intl/libintl.h
/opt/local/var/macports/software/gettext/0.17_2/opt/local/include/libintl.h
/sw/include/libintl.h

In the system.mk file, I've set

PREFIX=/opt/local

and

LUA_DIR=/opt/local

which is where things are on macosx when installing from macports...

Any chance you might be able to help me out? I've been trying all kinds of
things but can't get it to work...

Thanks a lot
Quentin

Add to the CFLAGS:
-I/opt/local/include
(in system.mk, 137th line)

As you can see from above, there's no -I/opt/local/include/ on the gcc
command line. PREFIX/include is not added to it automatically, and as
we're compiling libtu there, it doesn't get there through LUA_DIR either.
You should add it to EXTRA_INCLUDES.

Why don't you have a look at the port Makefile of whatever they had
(I'm sure it's still around somewhere), and see the changes they had
to make, and never bothered reporting back/on the list/or so?
