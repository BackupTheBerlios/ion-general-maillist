Hi,

is mod_dock supposed to implement the freedesktop system tray spec? I'm asking
because recent versions of both knetworkmanager and nm-applet fail to show up
in the dock for me, which is slightly annoying. Does this work for anyone, are
there workarounds? In ancient days, I could attach missing dock windows by
name, but apparently in this case they don't show up.

ciao,

No, it implements only the KDE(3?)-standard, you need to use something additional
I use docker for everything else, embedded in the statusbar.

Thanks, that does indeed give me network manager icons in my ion dock.

Not sure, but an alternative combo would be wicd-client + trayion.  I
find that they work well together.

hi, is there a simple way to disable 'mousefocus' on certain clients
(a on-screen keyboard, for example)?

There's the 'passive' winprop. There should be examples in the
list archives, maybe even something in the scripts repository.

thanks, i thought there must be a more obvious way, but this is what i did:

defwinprop{
  class = "Something",
  float = true,
  userpos = true,
  switchto = false,
  no_focus = true,
}

nmfcwins = {}

function no_mfocus(cwin,t)
  local winprop = ioncore.getwinprop(cwin)
  if winprop and winprop.no_focus then
    nmfcwins[cwin:xid()] = cwin:xid()
    ioncore.set{mousefocus="disabled"}
  end
end

function ret_mfocus(cxid)
  if nmfcwins[cxid]==cxid then
    nmfcwins[cxid]=nil
    if table.maxn(nmfcwins)==0 then
      ioncore.set{mousefocus="sloppy"}
    end
  end
end

ioncore.get_hook('clientwin_mapped_hook'):add(no_mfocus)
ioncore.get_hook('clientwin_unmapped_hook'):add(ret_mfocus)

this is only good for a few cases (i.e. a on-screen keyboard, that's
activated from the systray), but it does the job for me; i'll
investigate the passive property further, i noticed it before, but
wasn't sure how to use it in this case.

Hi all.

How can I tell ION to NOT grab the keyboard ?

I've ask that because I try to use some ?complexe? software (in fact
blender), and he have use lot of F1 --> F12 keyboard shortcuts. I don't
known how to change that (and I'm don't want to).

So I would like to known if it's easy to make ION don't do anything when I
launch blender all ION is disable ? 

Regards.

NB: Tuomov : where is your web page about ION ?
http://www.modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/ion/ give me a error.

It's possible to use 'WClientWin.quote_next(cwin)' to send the next
keypress to the client window, but to get exactly what you're
describing here, you'd have to use a ion hook of some kind to switch
(or turn off) key bindings, RTFM/lookup some examples for details.
(and yes, it's easy)

Also, there's always the possibility of changing ion keybinds so that
they don't intersect with blender's. (using an extra modifier key, for
example)

Not sure what's up with the homepage. I've uploaded the manual here http://folk.ntnu.no/bronner/temp/ionconf/ (I don't have the

As for the bindings, the quickest solution is probably to use the switch_bindings (attached here) script to temporally disable all ion bindings. A better, but more time consuming, solution would be to use a hook to disable/enable only the keybindings that conflicts, as M Rawash suggests.
