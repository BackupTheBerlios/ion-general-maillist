Hi, I want o task if its possible to restore previous ion session ( tob explicit, i created some workspaces, puted in nice order programs etc. and suddenly i have to restart computer, so i have to reorganize workspaces again). I havent found appropriate module or ion function to do this.

The workspaces shouldn't be a problem, just do a "clean exit" or
save the session manually (ioncore.snapshot()). 

Having applications start in the "right" frame is another problem
though. I understand that it can be solved with kludges etc, but 
I haven't bothered so I can't help you unfortunately. Other people 
on the list probably knows.

Thanks, unfortunately i havent mentioned that im using ion2 not ion3 so no ioncore.snapshot ... i think its time to move to ion3

Hi,

Both versions save workspaces' layouts to lua files, when doing clean exits.
IIRC both provide with a menu option to save / load workspaces in that file.

~/.ion2/default-session/workspaces.lua
~/.ion3/default-session--0/saved_layout.lua

What I did was saving the layouts I like then removing write
authorizations on that file with chmod so it wouldn't get overriden on
exit.


Happy tiling,

Right, application information isn't saved.

You need a session manager (and SM aware applications) to have
applications automatically saved and restored.

Getting applications to start in the correct frames when they do start up
(manually or automatically) requires winprops/kludges be set up (as was
previously mentioned).

As Etan said you have to use a SM or other personal tricks to only
launch / restore the apps you need.
Once your layout frames have names, and you know your favorite apps'
names and classes via xprop, you can setup kludges.

You can find examples for kludges.lua files on the Net:
 http://aperiodic.net/phil/configs/ion2/kludges.lua
 http://daelstorm.thegraveyard.org/ion2/ion2.html

Some apps may or may not have X names and classes, or they may be duplicate.
The typical example is emacs : if you want to open several windows in
different places,
you have to set command-line args to set them. The kludges then work as a charm.

 Thanks, i have tryied to do it in many ways and i have some nice lua/shell script so should be ok.

But i have another question. I'm using ion2/pwm2 and i want to resize actual window to some fixed sizes (maximize_vert and maximize_horiz_works only as they explicit say MAXIMALY ) i used request_geom(WRegion,size_table) but i have probelm with gettin current WRegion ( i read cerfully all manual and couldnt find function like WRegion WRegion.current() which would gave me handle to current region),s ohow to get it and maybe there is another way to fixed resize .

Regards Lukas

You should use correct binding (i.e., binding for WFrame or something
like that, I have no ion manual here), then the variable '_'
should contain the object, which was the binding triggered for. See
the part of manual that describes bindings.

Thanx, u are talking about ion3 not ion2 but any wy i just moved to ion3 and i have the same problem. Trying to set key to rezise windowes to fixed size, so ok i use WMoveresMode functions 

defbindings("WMoveresMode", {
   ...
   ...
   ...
   kpress(META.."R",     "WMoveresMode.rqgeom(_,{10,10,100,100})"),
})

Let say that META+"R" switches to 'resize' mode. So now pressing META+"R" than "R" shold rezise window ... buy nothing happen, other functions like WMoveresMode.resize(_,...)  works ok. So where is mistake in this example.
