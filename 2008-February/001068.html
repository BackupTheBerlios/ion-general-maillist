C.. and then some.

There's just no way around it: for any serious work you want C.
Or maybe some other relatively simple language close to the 
hardware, with better safety... and tagged unions. (What was 
this one C derivative?) But the benefits of such an alternative
(except for tagged unions) are not so great, because you only
want to write relatively simple things in C/it. You don't want
to write much abstractions in C. You do low level gruntwork of 
core libraries in C, provide a very simple API, and use whatever
language you want with better abstractions and better safety 
(hence typically no dynamically-typed scripting languages, but 
rather e.g. Haskell), to access the services provided by the C 
core libraries. This is easy because the API is simple (instead 
of OO bloat).

Non-performance critical libraries could also be written in 
other languages (such as Haskell), and they could provide a
simple C API, but conflicting runtimes present a problem. Many
languages (including Haskell, java, etc.) want to be operating
systems themselves these days. 

Instead of using the operating system's namespace to locate their
libraries, they want to impose their own module and package 
namespaces and hierarchies.

Instead of exposing the operating system's libraries and services,
and letting the program author choose either some real platform 
or a compatibility layer (platform), they want you to use their 
own compatibility layer. Megalomania pure and simple. And in 
exchange cross-language compatibility is reduced. For that you
either you either have to write for the &quot;C runtime&quot; (i.e. the OS),
or you need something like CLR (common language runtime). 

I think the C option could promote better API practises instead
of OO-bloat. You _do_ often want to write higher-level APIs suited
to the practises and mechanisms of any particular language, instead
of enforcing an uniform one. Those exposing a simple easy wrappable
API not dependent on the idiosyncracies of any particular language
or design methodology (such as OO-bloat), should work best.
