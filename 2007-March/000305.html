I agree, I've done the same ;) But there's no point in eradicating C-K
in the default bindings, that only pushed me to make my own scheme
(base on Win+arrows most of the time).

I've seen many people feeling the need to reconfigure their bindings
to fit their habits or their language, they wouldn't have done this
effort if at some point they did not find something really irritating.

But overall, the defaults are not so 'impossible' anyway.

&gt;<i> for &quot;find next&quot;, F5 for &quot;reload&quot;, and F6 for &quot;highlight location bar&quot;
</I>
You mean C-R and C-L (and its friend C-K) ? In Firefox / IE at least ;)


I also agree with Joerg, but having a keyboard full of MOD+single_key
combos would probably be really strange. There is a high probability
of a newbie being scared by a window split when mistakenly hitting
alt-S or Win-S instead of his often-used C-S.

I do not aim at being interface nazi but ion is about taking back
control, so why not incitate users to do so ? Anyone here added some
bindings or looked in the documentation for a rarely-used function he
needed, that's perfect !

You know your config, you are not surprised and you are efficient (if
not, you change again). The MS-Windows alt-shift combination for
changing keyboard input (FR-US) is often mistakenly typed and a
non-computer-literate person could really freak out (imagine what it
could have been if you installed dvorak...)


In short : force users to change their bindings ! They'll be happy ever after :)
ion3 users are not the casual user anyway, they won't be (so) scared.


Just my 2 cents.
