Indeed, there's some code to that end there too. However, the resize
modes etc. don't support further submaps. (Not that one would likely
want them in a vi-style mode anyway.)

Infact, now that I recall, I did write mod_mgmtmode, but never
finished it and removed it for the release. I can make it available
of there's interest in finishing it.

&gt;<i> To do this, I may tag  
</I>&gt;<i> the relevant windows, hit a magic key, and after that, the windows will  
</I>&gt;<i> show in a temporary workspace (i.e. fullscreen-like way), organized  
</I>&gt;<i> following an user-defined heuristic. Hit the magic keys again, and all  
</I>&gt;<i> windows would go back to their original location.
</I>
It's not difficult to script this. However, the 'placeholder'
mechanisms of Ion would be very useful in returning windows more
intelligently where they were. That is not currently exported on
the Lua side. It should not be that much work, and really should
be done, but once again I can't have been arsed. (I don't have
immediate personal use for the feature, it's gruntwork, and
I don't have much time for coding anyway.)

(A lot of the complexity of Ion's code is actually due to these
&quot;placeholders&quot; and pointers to them in other structures. They're
used to ensure that windows return from full screen mode exactly
where they were, that under a session manager applications restart
exactly where they were, and so on. Ion tries very hard to do these
things &quot;right&quot;.)

&gt;<i> 4bis) Somehow related to 4): when you organize your workspaces by task, it

</I>&gt;<i> seldom) use &quot;screen -x&quot; to do this.
</I>
Scriptable, but a bit ugly. Maybe there even was a script already,
as this is a sort FAQ item?
