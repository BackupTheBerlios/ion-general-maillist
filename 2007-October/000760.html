&gt;<i> This is the Acme/P9 interface [...] and it's just
</I>&gt;<i> utter and total crap on a typical horizontal-controls-
</I>&gt;<i> and-vertical-screen computer,
</I>
&quot;utter and total crap,&quot; hmm. Bah, I will let it to you.

A VERY knowledgeable guy (you certainly knows who he is) has
(among other things) designed a VERY nice programming language:
Eiffel. Unfortunately, he would--and does, indeed--call &quot;utter
and total crap&quot; everything is not Eiffel.

What to say? &quot;Teddy&quot; [Adorno] tells that every and each
masterpiece is the *mortal* enemy of the other one. Who knows.
Alternatively, an university assistant, a fellow among the very
few really good programmers [a mathematician by education, of
course] I have met, has remarked once at a cafeteria with the
*scherzoso ma non troppo* tone which distinguishes cafeterias'
conversations: --Uuuh, Bertrand is of the kind of geniuses which
should get a ... mouse :) plugged somewhere: click-click, &quot;help,
I have this specific problem/don't understand that, please
explain&quot;; and when he finishes, and begins speaking of other
things: &quot;another time, thank you Bertrand,&quot; click-click--.

&gt;<i> I've hit a command query key, typed a couple of letters of     
</I>&gt;<i> the command and hit &lt;tab&gt; faster than moving the hand to the   
</I>&gt;<i> mouse!                                                         
</I>
:<i>)
</I>
Maybe, but do you know The Hare and the Hedgehog tale by the
Brothers Grimm? (Beware.)

Besides: no one is saying that you couldn't longer type tabs, why
make it an aut aut?

&gt;<i> Not to even speak of pixel-hunting text with the pantograph that
</I>&gt;<i> the mouse is.
</I>
:<i>)
</I>
Look in a dictionary: agoraphobia. What do you have against
mice?

Cheers,
