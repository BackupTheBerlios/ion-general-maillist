The X we all knew is dying, and it's being killed by its developers.

As their latest onslaught, the Xorg dickheads have removed 
SaveUnders from X. Expect flicker when dragging tabs or 
moving windows under Ion and a new and rusy X. They want you
to implement and use a heavy memory, cpu, and battery-hungry
composite manager instead... and do not provide a generic 
one worth shit.

They do not follow the original design of X and extend it; 
they gradually replace everything with crap and remove the 
old ways of doing things. Soon on their list will be core
the good old fonts, as they want you to use their blur-fascist
fantasies. It's impossible to keep up with the shit that the 
FOSScracy throws at you, unless you're one of the big 
corporate-sponsored projects that is already part of the FOSScracy.

The lamers even banned me from posting on the list. Censorship, 
silencing the critique. Sure sing of an incompetent tyranny.


It was a good time to switch to Windows. X as we knew it will 
soon no longer be. 


Something to laugh at:

On the same tread, the fuckwits discuss how they need some way
to identify displays for DPI settings etc... after they removed
simple display identification by switching from the good old X
multihead o Xinerama/Xrandr crap.

In 1995, Linux was almost a bicycle; an alternative way of live to the
Windows petrol beasts that had to be taken to the dealer for service.
By 2008, Linux has bloated into a gas-guzzler, and the cycle paths 
have been replaced with polluted motorways.
