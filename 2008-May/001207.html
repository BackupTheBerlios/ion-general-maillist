May be I was misleaded by the fact, that the color of the titlebar keeps
color style of focused frame but in the frame the transient does not
give focus away though.

Thats not the case here, this works fine in float mode.

Yes :-) Even more annoying this is.

But not in float mode, right? In float mode of these Application the
DRC-Error Box is above the Main Application though, but I can move back
to Main Window and type keys into it then.

When i invoke the application in float mode and activate the DRC-Error
toolbox and tag main application and attach it to a new tiled frame, 
still I can input keys into main application and use the tool box.

Only when invoked from tiled mode this tool box seems to not give 
keyboard focus away. I realize now in order to poke around with xprops.
This is what me annoys a bit since the &quot;not not givefocus away&quot; is my
desired behaviour...

Before there is misunderstanding on my side, is this a transient?

Semi-PS.:
Such Dialogs invoked in tiled frames are strechted about the horizontal
width completely, can this be switched off somewhere?

&gt;<i> all. Separate _toolbox windows_ -- which are in themselves a fundamental 
</I>&gt;<i> design flaw -- should not be marked as transient. 
</I>
I agree completely, this is a rotten mess...

&gt;<i> client in the current frame. The 'float' winprop might do something more
</I>&gt;<i> useful. Maybe some of the scripts in the scripts repository also did 
</I>&gt;<i> something useful; check it. 
</I>
Nice Idea, I woll check this area for something like this now.

&gt;<i> It is also possible to put windows managed in the group of a main window 
</I>&gt;<i> on a non-modal stacking level. This will, however, require a custom
</I>&gt;<i> clientwin_do_manage_alt hook handler or an attach script, as it is only
</I>&gt;<i> possible to set the stacking level from a WMPlex.attach[_new] call. 
</I>&gt;<i> (Levels starting from 1024 are modal.) Maybe someone can write a script...
</I>
This also sounds useful and I am interested getting a point to look at
where and how to start such a script :-)

Kind Regards, Konsti
