All I've ever had swsusp do, is crash and panic. And even if it didn't 
crash, I seriously doubt it works seamlessly with X (and the proprietary
NVidia drivers). Not that I have been able to try it recently, because 
upgrade the kernel is practically impossible. And how about encrypted 
swaps? Probably needs some serious hacking not nicely and _safely_ 
integrated into distros to get it working.

[[Running over a year old 2.6.14. Newer versions AFAIK no longer have
decent SATA drivers with the devices as predictable /dev/hde etc., 
instead demanding random SCSI mapping insanity and hence udev. An udev
itself is crypto-slugware, the kid of crap that I will not have on my 
system. Plus compiling the kernel is a week long task: one day trying 
make oldconfig to notice that it doesn't work, a few days for the 
initial configuration, a few more days fixing it, and then a few days
trying to restore the  system to be able to run the old kernel. 
Linux sucks. 

And the stock kernels in the distributions boot years loading every
single module in a random order, so that you dont't get the integrated
buzzchip as the first sound card, the wrong ethernet interface as eth0
and so on. And the tools to customise the initrd demand -- you guessed
it -- the plague of udev. Linux sucks.

Today the network went down and apparently the kernel can't handle my
static and dynamic IP not being in the same subnets now, not finding
the routes. Newer kernels might not have the bug, but I can't upgrade
for the above-mentioned reasons. Linux sucks.

I wish FreeBSD got ice1712 driver so I could perhaps switch to
Debian/kFreeBSD. Linux sucks.]]
