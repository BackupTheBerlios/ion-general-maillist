It shouldn't be this drastic - &quot;emerge --deep --update --newuse world&quot; 
followed by &quot;revdep-rebuild&quot; should take care of most of this.

Differences in performance/ram usage between gcc 3.4 and gcc 4.1 are trivial 
(although if you went from 4.0 to 4.1, then 4.1 will carry more significant 
performance increases in some cases, but it's best to deal with these kinds 
of things on a case by case basis).

&gt;<i> , to save ram and to prevent problems, I did most of it from the

</I>
Well, as long as you discovered ion :-)

&gt;<i> Although KDE applications get trapped wonderfully in the doc. Skype, does

Yes, skype is broken.  It's not even 100% perfect when used with kwin/kde.  
The CVS version of kopete has rudimentary skype support.. you might find it's 
enough for your needs.

&gt;<i> oh, another question, how to I quit the wm with the keyboard? I did not

</I>
Bind a key to &quot;ioncore.shutdown()&quot;.
