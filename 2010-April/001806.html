</I>
The last version of the licence can be seen at:

<A HREF="http://git.decadent.org.uk/gitweb?p=ion3.git;a=blob;f=LICENSE;h=fdfa652c68cd5d06ec2383e7ea4429e6dc5cb4d0;hb=e3aec18706513a87eaa7839dfdaf7e0fcd0d8d2a">http://git.decadent.org.uk/gitweb?p=ion3.git;a=blob;f=LICENSE;h=fdfa652c68cd5d06ec2383e7ea4429e6dc5cb4d0;hb=e3aec18706513a87eaa7839dfdaf7e0fcd0d8d2a</A>

You can fork it but then you must rename it.  Tuomo said in the past
that this included functional use of the name 'Ion' such as in the
installation directories.  This restriction was introduced in the
copyright licence of ion-3rc-20070506; if you fork an earlier version
then you should only have to consider trademark rights.

&gt;<i> Secondly, there was some project like 'ion3 with scripts in python but
</I>&gt;<i> without tuomo', unfortunately i can not give you it's name or link to
</I>&gt;<i> it. It was dead when i lurked about it, but it has no licensing
</I>&gt;<i> problems - so you can just fork it and write the code you need.

Qtile?  wmii?

There's a long list of tiling window managers at
