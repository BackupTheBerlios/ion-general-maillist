Except Gnomefox (like a lot of Gtk shite) probably won't set even
the title before it maps the window.

Message-ID: <92f2ef410707060518i603f2d58u5e1c12bd23459b8@mail.gmail.com>

I use the latest snapshot (20070608) and statusbar_external script this way:
In my cfg_ion.lua I have:
-- ---
statusbar_external = {
...
}
dopath ("statusbar_external")
dopath("mod_statusbar")
-- ---
and on startup ion says:

Ion startup error log:
>> Errors starting ion-statusd:
   /usr/lib/ion3/bin/ion-statusd: Unable to find 'statusd_cpufreq' on
search path.
   /usr/lib/ion3/bin/ion-statusd: Unable to find 'statusd_acpibat' on
search path.
   /usr/lib/ion3/bin/ion-statusd: Unable to find 'statusd_cpupolicy'
on search path.

These are meters, defined in statusbar_external={}. And they work
fine! But such message is being displayed on each startup. Should I
try to fix statusbar_external.lua in any way or is it a mod_statusbar
issue?

Quoting http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/repos/ion-scripts-3/ :

    If you are using ion-3ds-20060107 or later, using statusd_exec.lua
    instead of this old version is suggested.

Hi,

I have just upgraded my trusty Slackware box to recently released
12.0.  This brings about an upgrade to the X.org 7.1 X server.

Unfortunately, the ion2 module mod_xrandr-2 has stopped working.  I
have debugged the issue as much as I could, and I am afraid I am not
proficient enough in X programming to carry on.

Here's what seems to be going on:
- XRandR registring and so on works.
- Ion (and mod_xrandr) also get the X event notifications for randr
  events.
- However, the call
     FIND_WINDOW_T(rev->root,WScreen) 
  in mod_xrandr.c returns NULL, suggesting that Ion is unable to get a
  hold of a WScreen object that is correlated with rev->root (rev
  being the notification event), if I understand correctly.

What is going wrong here all of a sudden?  Can anybody offer me some
advice as to how to proceed from here?

Thanks in advance,
Toby.

Tuomo,

I'm sorry I'm ripping this thread apart, but for some reason, I have
not yet received your reply.  I did, however, see it in the online
archives, so I'll answer to it.

Your question was why I didn't upgrade to ion3.  Mainly, the reason is
that Ion3 is still just an RC, while Ion2 is labled "stable".  Thus, for
my production machine, I preferred to stick to ion2.

Now, I have tested ion3 on my upgraded machine, and the xrandr problem
went away, admittedly.  However, I have to say that I do have a hard
time migrating my config files from ion2 to ion3.  :-(

Either way, I was under the impression that ion2 was still "the"
officially supported stable version, so I assumed that you'd be
interested to hear about the xrandr problem, and I had hoped that
someone could help me fix it.

Cheers,
Toby.

Ion2 may still (for a few months) be grudgingly officially supported, 
but mod_xrandr has never been properly supported. It's just something
that is available, and I'm not going to start going to lengths to 
debug problems with an old Ion2 version, now that Ion3 will be 
released soon(tm). (Just one more RC, hopefully...)

I (and lots of other people) have been using ion3 for years on my
production machine without real troubles. So, stability is not really
an argument indeed.

I have never said so.  Indeed, I have never really used ion3 at all.
All I am saying is that, according to the web page, ion2 is the
current stable release.  That's all.  It may very well be that ion3 is
very stable already, but that is not the point.  It is not labeled the
current "stable" (production) version, so I didn't use it, because
apparently the developers themselves don't think that ion3 is good
enough to be labeled "stable" yet (although that may not be far down
the road).

Cheers,
Toby.

Okay, point taken.

Good enough.  I was just asking if anyone had any hints on how to go
ahead in troubleshooting the issue.  I was not trying to start a
discussion of why or why not to upgrade to ion3.

Meanwhile, I have upgraded to ion3 because of your advise.  Now, the
xrandr module works again; however, mod_dock does not work properly
any more.  After a xrandr resize operation, the dock is gone.  Any
thoughts on this?

Sounds interesting.  Do you have any pointers that explain the make
bug or can you briefly explain it?  Googling for this issue turned up
only pages (such as
http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/parallel_make.html) telling
me, if parallel make fails, the Makefile is wrong

If parallel make fails, make is too stupid.

Errr.

Do you expect also any sequential program to work if you start using
threads, and will you blame the pthread library if it doesn't do
synchronization for you?

make -j will work if you didn't rely on make being sequential, but
what can make do with something like

all: target1 target2

target1:
	some-action

target2:
	some-action that requires target1 to be built.


?

Yes, if the program has been written in a suitable manner. I am not
aware of any such hacks in the Ion makefiles, and `make -j3` works
just fine (on a single CPU, of course). If someone has a real and
not just imagined problem, they should point at where it is instead
of just complaining. I'm not going to waste my breath finding and 
fixing problems that are only relevant on the latest techno-gadgets.
My AthlonXP still has many years of life left in it, assuming 
built-in obsolescence doesn't kick in.

I'm seeing something similar, the dock either becomes an outline of
itself, or gets positioned somewhere along the top of the screen, as if
it hadn't been updated to take the larger resolution into account again
(I normally have it in the top right hand corner).

That's because the dock module doesn't use the standard sizepolicy
stuff, but does its own position management. I probably can't be
arsed to change this, because it would be a major rewrite. I've
actually thought of removing the module as redundant, and as
something I don't particularly care to maintain, not originally
being my code.

Huh?  How do I get the same functionality out of other modules?  I'm
not hooked on the dock module, but I really would like to have a dock
that a) can be turned on and off and b) also appears on empty screens.

If, say, the status bar can be coaxed to behave like that, I'd be more
than happy to switch over.

Cheers,
Toby.

Err, sure, but the claim of Tuomo was that "make" had to be clever,
not the Makefile ("If parallel make fails, make is too stupid."). Mine
is that "make" can not guess where the synchronizations have to be,
and if "make -j" fails, the first thing I'd do is to check the
Makefile, not to claim it's a make bug.

Subject: gnome-panel as dock
Message-ID: <6851ad7e0707091818n33fa1ebsd7e769c0eea1f78d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to use gnome-panel as my dock in ion3 and it is mostly working,
but I have one problem with it.  I attached a screenshot of what is
happening.  Essentially there is a portion of the screen that is unusable
situated directly above the panel.

Here's what I have done so far.

At the top of cfg_dock.lua:

mod_dock.create{
    mode="embedded",
    screen=1,
    pos="bl",
    grow="right",
    is_auto=true,
    floating_hidden=false,
    name="*dock*",
}

and at the bottom:

defwinprop{
    class = "Gnome-panel",
    instance = "gnome-panel",
    target = "*dock*",
}

I also tried adding a max_size to the defwinprop, but that didn't change
anything.

Is there anything I can do to fix this?


Thanks,
Kevin Beranek

Yes, forget Gnome. Gnome is an anti-Ion, and together they will

Message-ID: <14989d6e0707100149j14535b4di403f76465bbf10cb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I'm a happy user of ion, at home as well as at work.
Problem is: At work we're using the Citrix Client to be able to use
some Windoze applications from within Solaris.
Citrix is a hell of a X11 application. It resizes its windows, forces
window placement, movement and so on. It doesn't work very well with
many window managers, leading to placement errors, disappearing
windows. Or crashes.
With ion, the Citrix client is nearly unusable. Even if you create a
new workspace with an "empty" layout it's a mess. I won't blame ion
for this. There's no need for an application to handle window manager
tasks...

As a solution I created a fullscreen workspace and attached a Xnest to
it. The Citrix client uses Xnest without any window manager. So far
this runs pretty stable. I can recommend this way for every
misbehaving application.
The only thing that bothers me is that I don't get "window alarms"
(events), and that I can't access the individual windows inside Xnest
from ions controls.
Is there a tool that could do this, or that could be used as a starting point?

Regards
Christian

This does not actually answer your question, but did you consider
using rdesktop (http://www.rdesktop.org/)?  We were using the Citrix
ICA Client, too, but we switched to rdesktop several months ago and I
had no problems with it so far.

Cheers,

Andreas.

PS: I was using the ICA client from Citrix under Linux with ion with
no problem...

Subject: Dock padding_pixels suggestion
Message-ID: <f70oqf$mv8$1@sea.gmane.org>

Hi,

I'm trying to use Ion 3 with ROX[1], and fixing a few problems as I go
(we're missing transient-for in places, etc... oops!).

One minor issue I noticed is that the dock has a 1 pixel border by
default. Normally, to run something in ROX's panel you just whack the
pointer in the general direction of the screen edge and click, but with
the border gap that doesn't work.

Perhaps the style below could be added to the default theme to change that?

de.defstyle("stdisp", {
    padding_pixels = 0,
})

Thanks,

BTW, I noticed this in the not-a-blog:

 "The middlemen known as ?distributions? have effective control over the
 software that people install. Authors can not hope to compete with the
 juggernaut distributions' easily installable packages, the only practical
 method for them to distribute their software being laboursome source
 packages that users must hunt down from the Web. [...] They provide old
 buggy versions and even out-dated development snapshots for years without
 prominent version qualifiers, and expect the author to deal with the
 users having problems with the bugs and incompatibilities in these
 versions."

I used to have exactly the same problems with ROX-Filer, but now I just
provide a Zero Install[2] feed for it. On most modern Linux distributions
(including Ubuntu and Fedora), any user can just do:

$ 0alias rox http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Filer

Then they can run it with the command 'rox'. It gets the latest binary
version from my site, checks the signature using my GPG key and installs
it. It also checks for updates from time-to-time. Have you thought of
providing Ion that way?

The dock is for window maker dockapps, and as such needs a border in 
many styles. I have actually considered removing the dock module from 
the Ion distribution as I'm not really interested in maintaining it.
(It could still be installed separately, if someone else bothered
maintaining it... I consider it mostly redundant.)

You know, you're really doing things all wrong by putting the panel
thingy in the dock. You should just make the panel itself the stdisp.
This can be done with WMPlex.set_stdisp. I'm not 100% if it works in 
an initial window management hook: I've not actually tested if the
hooks are usable at all... It would be nice if someone tried that 
out with a real application. There could also be some issues with
size hint usage, which could still be fixed.

I will post another reply.

That sounds better. I'm not sure how to do it though (I'm still new to Ion!).

Which hook should I connect to? I guess I need to get called when a new
screen is created, and then pass '_' as the first argument to set_stdisp,
right? I tried this, but _ is nil:

ioncore.get_hook("ioncore_post_layout_setup_hook"):add(
    function()
	panel = WMPlex.set_stdisp(_, {pos = 'bl'})
    	WRegion.set_name(panel, "panel")
    end
)

defwinprop{
    class = "ROX-Filer",
    instance = "ROX-Panel",
    target = "panel",
}

Thanks,

No, I was not even aware of zeroinstall, and from quick glance, can  
spot a few real or potential problems:

  * Package creation seems to be a choice between WIMPshit and XMLshit, 
    judging from the packaging tutorial. No thanks.

  * How about dependencies? That's where these decentralised 
    packaging systems tend to fail compared to distros.
   
On the positive side, it seems to use URLs and local aliases
(that apply to binaries too!), instead of relying on a fully 
centralised naming scheme. It's not fully decentralised, though,
because DNS is centralised.

I've actually been thinking lately a bit about decentralised
packaging systems, and have been meaning to write about it
in the non-blog in more detail. In summary, the key 
features/principles would, however be:

  * Uses application directories (with relocatable binaries, so
    can be installed anywhere). That's absolutely necessary for
    decentralised packaging.

  * The package would not be the unit of dependency, but various
    capabilities, that packages (which are merely archive files 
    found in any way whatsoever) can claim to provide -- and any
    number of them. Some capabilities would correspond to individual
    programs ("Ion3"), and some would be more abstract and could 
    have multiple packages providing them ("libfoo API 1.2").
    How each capability is supposed to be provided is up to the
    capability author, and packages could be required to include
    a file specifying how it provides the capability (the library
    file name, executable name, anything)

  * "Cryptographically unique" capability names. The name would 
    e.g. be the public key signed with the private key of a keypair.
    Perhaps this would be the author's key, followed by a path,
    essentially creating a decentralised DNS (something I've also
    written about). 

  * Packages would use these cryptographic names (possibly locally
    aliased in some file to something more manageable) to refer to 
    their dependencies. They might also recommend a particular
    package implementing the capability. When some installed package
    already claims to provide a capability, but another package
    recommends something else, the user would be asked about it.

  * The same keypair can be used to prove that a package provides
    a capability by signing the package with the private key of
    the capability. Alternatively the capability author could
    provide a signed test suite that can be used to verify that
    a package provides the claimed capability.

  * The package system would be integrated with the build system.
    Presently there's a _lot_ of redudancy between distributions'
    package descriptions and autocrap. But a decent build system
    would include all the dependency information in an easily
    accessible format [1].

  * The package system itself does not specify how packages are
    found, but as single-click-install is too complex, and
    single-command-fetch-and-install is the way to go, presumably
    install tools could use some kind of search engine (google
    is the new DNS!) tailored for finding such package files
    directly, and let the user choose among the results. When
    the capability identifier is used to search, there should
    often be only one result, and even more often only one
    result that provably provides the capability, so the
    interaction needs should be minimal when installing 
    dependencies or upgrading known packages. 

    When the cryptographic identifier is not known, some
    method of scoring the (text/name search) results is needed. 
    Perhaps good old PageRank suffices. Additionally some
    instance that people trust could sign capability keys
    to correspond to some customary name for the capability.

Hmm... this was meant to be a summary... :) Well, there are
still some blurry details.

That's the wrong hook. You probably want "clientwin_do_manage_alt",
and the function you pass to it must accept parameters. You should
check for some custom winprop field (or less preferrably but more
directly for the rox panel class and instances) in the function,
if it's a match, do the setup.

WMPlex.set_stdisp wants an attach_new style table will that work with a
clientwin or would he have to create an new frame and then stick the cwin
into the frame? Or did I not follow the code far enough?

Ah. The table in this case is

   { reg = the_clientwin_i_got_as_parameter_to_the_hook }

plus the additional variables specific to set_stdisp.

Ah, I see it now, I am only recently coming to try to understand the

The third option is 0publish (non-GUI):

 http://0install.net/0publish.html

On the other hand, you've already written a download page in HTML, so how
much worse can XML be?

ROX-Filer doesn't list any (it just assumes everyone has GTK), but if you
want some examples that do, try:

$ 0alias svn http://0install.net/2007/3rd-party/Subversion.xml

That will also download up to 11 other libraries, although it might
default to fewer if you're on a Debian-type system and you have some of
them already, and a new enough version of 0alias. You can choose whether
to use the distribution's packages or download the Zero Install ones, in
that case.

Another example of dependencies is if you compile ROX-Filer from source:

$ 0alias 0compile http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0compile.xml
$ 0compile setup http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Filer

That will download old versions of the GTK header files to compile
against, so that the resulting binary works everywhere, not just on new
systems.

True, although you can use IP addresses (same problem ultimately, though).

Of course.

We don't really support those at the moment. Maybe when there are more

Certainly. If you can download libraries on demand then you don't need to
test to find out what you've got; you just ask for what you want.

I am moving away from the window maker dockapps too. (Many
reasons for that.) Actually I have migrated already, by,
say, 70-80%. (The remaining percent will be handled soon.)

Who knows xosd^1 ("X On Screen Display library")? I have
started to use the library in conjunction with Perl
(X::Osd - Perl extension to xosd) ... you could use C if
you prefer though it would make less sense (unless you
know C and absolutely not Perl).

One can replace/emulate--in a much more *elegant* [and
consistent] way--window maker dockapps with xosd and
X::Osd.


Cheers,


/Roy Lanek


     1. man xosd - is a library for displaying an
on-screen display (like the one on many TVs) on your X
display.

Same thing then... you're using a tool to create the HTML/XML for you.
Generate it however you want. If the final format isn't XML or similar
then normal browsers won't render it (which isn't a serious problem, but
it looks nicer formatted).

In that file (use View Source to see the XML if you're using a browser),
there is this bit:

 <requires interface="http://0install.net/2007/3rd-party/libsvn1.xml">
   <environment insert="usr/lib" name="LD_LIBRARY_PATH"/>
 </requires>

That in turn depends on other things...

In fact, the subversion packages mirror the structure of the Debian
packages because that's where I copied the binaries from (someone was
explaining to me how it was impossible to backport svn 1.4 to Debian/sarge
because of all the dependencies...)

And which tool would let me edit a package description in a decent format?

The problem with XML is that it's totally illegible, and there aren't decent
tools for it... and if there were, it could just as well be binary and thus
_much_ more efficient.

Well, at least it has a package (although not capability) based 
dependency system unlike autopackage. (Actually, that definition
does include a partial description of how the depended-upon library
provides a wanted capability: with 'insert="usr/lib" name="LD_LIBRARY_PATH"'.
It's just in the wrong place: it should be in the libsvn1 description,
with Subversion depending only on the capability.)

Hah! My telly has a led statusbar below the screen! (Plus a
mono speaker, bulbaceous CRT, and heavy 80's chipboard casing.)

Anyway, although I don't use dockapps myself (Ion's own statusbar
is quite enough), the real reason why the dock is largely redundant
is that the statusbar can (and does by default unless the dock is
loaded) display the dockapps.

Just try with a notebook--then you might become interested

I searched for "depen", and didn't find anything. And glancing at XML
for alternatives is totally useless. You need documentation both to
read it and write it -- just like binary.

seconds. I use it as a serial terminal to fix hung X occasionally.

And people do talk of British humor ... (Finnish one is
much better.)

Okay, but this is for the lucky ones in Kokkola or
Lappeenranta! (I never have been in Finland, and I am
Swiss, by the way.)

Here where I live (West Sumatra) the temperature on
the day is around 30 C [and 25 on the night ... at sea
level]. The air humidity goes up till 80% and beyond
[evening/night or raining seasons], which makes 30, even
25 C feel like 40 in Zurich, Lugano, or Helsinki,

And if it's the *right* day, you may see 5-6-7 power
outages [varying from 5 seconds to 1-2-3-... hours; 20
hours has been the longest, single interval last month].

Ditto for Jakarta, Medan or Pekanbaru (though not that
many times a day). Even in industrial Shanghai/China,
slightly aside from here, it should not be much, much
better [power outages] in general.

I own an S73 series BenQ JoyBook, which I like VERY, VERY
much, I recommend you, and is KICK ASS for the buck [the
display is GORGEOUS by the way ... BenQ oblige]. ("Too
Fucking Expensive," are you thinking at Lenovo, Toshiba or
Compaq? Agreed then.)

I use encrypted swap, so I can't suspend the mP, I just
step the mP down [ I could suspend it actually, but I
am not interested in that--I would need a non volatile
key--and there are more cons than pros eventually from my
perspective].

Nor I do spin down the hard disk--for reasons.

You may thankfully understand that given people with
a notebook are glad if they can monitor two-three
ACPI-things, not just because it makes fun or is gaga.

Well, British broadcast _humour_ is better, because the Finnish
equivalent is absolutely non-existent. That is, unless your 
concept of humour is a the level of a three-year-old.

When it's 40C in Helsinki (in shade), the hell has frozen
over (and migrated on the equator).

And yet the Finns seem obsessed with air conditioning these
days... I'm freezing in this office! Stuff your AC where the
sun _does_ shine!

Really, there should be no need for AC at these latitudes,
at least if they knew how to build decent buildings with
decent natural ventilation... but no, even natural light
is too difficult these days.

Well, the use of AC is a self-reinforcing need...

All the semi-tolerable laptops I've seen are upwards from 
1500e, which is too much considering the kind of fragile
consumer junk the devices are, and how much real use I
would have for one. For under 1000e you can only get 17"
GlareScreen -- now with a mirror, for the same price! --
dragtops with battery life not much better than my 486.
It's funny how in laptops the smaller the screen, the more
expensive it is, whereas normally it would be the opposite
(assuming the resolutions aren't hugely different).

Linux software suspend support totally sucks... it

for restore from encrypted swap. ... It should be
necessary to compile your own initrds for faster
boot process using the stock kernels. It should not
be necessary to touch initrds at all, directly, for
decent non-idiot box performance.

I actually spin down two of the three disks of my
tabletop computer (w/ noflushd), because they're
used only infrequently and eat a lot of electricity.
(athcool is nice too... no I _do not_ have fancy
frequency scaling shit.)

And the Ion statusbar isn't sufficient for that?
Although, I suppose that for warnings an OSD might
be nice... I'd actually like an OSD log kind of 
replacement for xmessage... integrated with Ion's
window activity/urgency  stuff.

There is actually a lua binding to xosd around and I wrote my own before
finding the other one, I'm partial to mine (for the obvious reasons, but
also for some non-obvious ones).

My version is available from http://unreliablesource.net/luaxosd/. I
actually also wrote some ion3 scripts to use the bindings (which is why I
wrote them in the first place) that I have never gotten around to finally
cleaning up and submitting. If people would find them useful I will work
on that maybe tonight.

The S73 series BenQ JoyBook I have mentioned is priced
around 1000.- USD in Indonesia, ergo, less than 1000.-
euro. (And trust me: it's more than "semi-tolerable.")


> for faster boot process

I am on runit (daemontools alike--just better IMO) for
70-80%. (100% runit/daemontools starts to become too
*convoluted*; plus: I LOVE *BSD like init-scripts, their
clarity and manageability.)

It's a trade-off: non notebook hard disks are not built
for frequent power off: the electricity then eaten for
manufacturing new- /recycling old disks.


> And the Ion statusbar isn't sufficient for that?

the battery status is, e.g., something that looks:

                         charged: 100%
     |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

or 
                      discharging: 72%
     ||||||||||||||||||||||||||-------

or
                         charging: 20%
     |||||||--------------------------

(with "charged: 100%" etc. written in, say, 

     -*-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

and the scale written in green, or red, depending from
the status.)

Why do you think such a thing, and others similar,
need to be put in the statusbar?

People can--from the physiology--separate *cognitively*
around five items.

And from the physiology again: the retina is--given some
generic grade of alertness--more reactive for things that
move/shift/flip/change... on the borders/sides than in
the center [guess why]. With xosd I can freely use four,
reasonably two, sides of a screen. And don't have to
bother on what happens beneath it.

And double that in .fi... if it were available. It's also still
rather big with a 14.1" screen... The S61 (w/ 12.1") that I found
by googling for the former is more to the size, although still 
quite heavy (1.5kg). The UMPCs are more to my liking than normal
laptops actually, but still not good enough (too crappy screen
size to device size ratio). I'd like something that can be carried
in a (rather big) pocket (pocket book sized), but not as small
and useless as crappy PDAs or iDiotphones (haven't seen anything
"smart" about them yet).

> I am on runit (daemontools alike--just better IMO) for

Doesn't help when the system tries to load every single
kernel module that it can find -- and ends up placing
the devices in random order. (But then again, Linux has
become totally useless recently with all HDs always in
random order, even without the module lottery.)

The disks spin up approximately once a day, which they would in
any case if it was easier to actually shut down the computer 
without shutting down the programs... which Linux doesn't make
easy enough, unlike Windows. (And one could optimise the spin 
downs a bit with an option to noflushd (or an awful hack that
I'm too lazy to write) to have longer delays for spindown
during the day than night.)

> Why do you think such a thing, and others similar,

It's a nice place. You could also use some (unicode) block character
hacks for a rather compact bar display... or a systray icon. OSD 
can be nice for warnings and such, but I wouldn't want the screen
constantly littered with information.

Availability is another story, but don't be fooled by the
14.1" screen mention ("16:10 1280x800 TFT LCD, 200nits,"
it's *larger* than 14.1" might tell at 1st view ...
BenQ, a spin off of Acer, is within #1-#3 in displays
production, you may trust them on the topic).

Put a glance at:


"kaitech.hk - For HK gadget maniacs - BenQ Joybook S73G
Full Review"

[compared are the Sony's SZ, and the LG's TX Express too]


http://www.kaitech.hk/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,71/topic,637.msg3189

This is the precise, or nearly identical Joybook model I
own; just that mine has been bought in Jakarta, not in
Hong Kong.


Summary [edited; and no, I have ZERO to do with BenQ]:

PROS:

* Dual Core. Up to 80% faster than the Pentium-M 1.73 GHz
Sonoma

* Very bright 200nits LCD. Beautiful                                        

* Powerful ATi X1600 with 256MB. More powerful than my
desktop's GeForce 6600GT AGP

* 4 USB Ports: 1 on each left/right side. 2 at the back

* Both D-Sub VGA and DVI-D ports available

* Ultra quiet, even when the CPU/GPU are stressed to the
limit

* Internal 5-in-1 card reader now supports 2GB SD Cards.
Previous models cannot

* Inexpensive. PRICE PER PERFORMANCE AND FEATURES ARE OUT
OF THIS WORLD. No competitors! [emphasis mine]

[Roy:] * Bluetooth [up to 9 m range, good for using a
mouse--the optical, Bluetooth Logitech V270 works like a
beauty--and to print]

CONS

* Very hot when playing graphics intensive games.
Definitely not a "laptop" [can't tell, I use a PS2 for
playing games]

* Very warm on the area where you rest your wrist when
typing on the notebook ["very"?!]

* Poor battery life: 2 hours for 3 games, 3 hours for DVD

* No Infrared (its infrared port is for the remote control
only. Nothing else) [don't care, but what about BT?]

* slightly overweight for a 14" notebook [not sure: it's
more thin and wide--which pleases me by the way--maybe
it's that that gives the (false) impression of being
"overweight"].


> Doesn't help when [...]

The JoyBook [which is intended for my wife and my
first-born daughter] will go up in the morning, when my
wife has placed it on the desk of her office; will go down
on the evening, when my wife will bring it home; then it
will go up again till the morning--with interruptions when
the batteries are running to low. (Everything, minus swap
and an ext2 nosuid,usrquota /tmp, is xfs nonetheless.) And
so on.

> It's a nice place.

:)

As it is the corner of the carpet (for wiping dirt under
it) too.

Seriously speaking: I have not tried yet, but given that
a monitor real estate is always scarce, I am thinking to
display some info on the right (vertically) too.

I currently have, e.g.:

    mp: 63 C
    hd: 38 C

horizontally. [I am using an iXoft Thermaltake notebook
fanless cooler by the way]

I am curious to try:

    mp
    63


    hd
    38

vertically [I am continental European, and care little on F in
general]


> I wouldn't want the screen constantly littered with
> information.

Neither do I. If one doesn't play with patissier/boulanger
decorations and effects; stays understatement, and thinks
at Antoine de Saint-Exupery from time to time, there is
little danger to litter a screen.

Even once a day is too much and too long with the module 
loading clusterfucks that distro's default kernels and
initrds are (not to mention the random ordering of 
devices without the infestation of udev).

XFS aka. eXtremely Futile System. It's the most brain-damaged file
system I have ever met; the most pointless file system I know of. 
Could someone please tell me, what's the _fucking point_ in a 
journalling file system that requires UPS? Isn't journalling
supposed to help to recover from crashes? XFS _deliberately_ loses 
data on crash -- and not just a few minutes worth of it, as would 
be case with a non-journalling file system, but _days_ (years --
all open files?) worth of it. That's just fucking pointless.
If all the files are full of zero-bytes, what the fuck does it
matter if the metadata is intact?

(Yes, I've lost a lot of data thanks to XFS. Never again will
I be misled to trying out such utter and total _shit_, no matter
how fast and shiny the ?ber-geeks claim it to be.)

I'd suggest you use 0publish-gui to create the feed. GUI's aren't very
scriptable, but you're only doing it once. Then add to it by calling the
command-line tool (0publish) in your release script.

If you want to convert XML to a more friendly format, there are other tools
for that:

http://slip.sourceforge.net/
http://www.langdale.com.au/SOX/

My text editor (Vim) understands XML somewhat anyway, so I haven't felt
the need to use them.

It uses the 'dependency injection' model (AKA 'inversion of control').
Instead of each component finding its dependencies (e.g. by searching
/usr/lib), each component is told where to find its dependencies. So, this
is an input to the 'svn' component, telling it which 'libsvn' to use.

But, it's not clear from that example because I'm using the unmodified
Debian subversion binaries and the only way to tell svn "Use this libsvn"
is to stick it in LD_LIBRARY_PATH and let it find it by searching. Ideally,
it would be:

   <environment insert="usr/lib" name="LIB_SVN_DIR" mode="replace"/>

And you'd link it (if ld supported this) with something like:

  $ gcc ... -l"$LIB_SVN_DIR/libsvn.so"

Or, in a really ideal world you wouldn't have to specify the binding
method at all, because there would be a standard way to tell a component
where its libraries are.

But that's once again more work for editing XML than a decent format,
unless the text editor automatically does the conversion... but then
we're back at this: the format could just as well be binary, and
hence more efficient. XML is pointless.

I was more after the practical aspects of creating a package and
defining dependencies for it, but good to hear that. (Present
handling of library deps is mess down to gcc itself.)

In my capability system, the package providing the depended-upon
capability tells how it provides the capability, the information
provided or mechanisms used having been specified by the capability
author. So you'd have something like

  [provided.capabilities.libfooAPI]
  uuid = zxc09z87df890asas?dklfj-w3,j.4324asdf08972342340+89sdfadsf9872etc.
  library-file = $PREFIX/lib/libbar.so

in 'libbar' that provides what is locally known as "libfooAPI" and 
globally referenced to with the given uuid that would include the
public key for that capability and a signature by the private key.
The program requiring the capability/library would have something like:

  [required.capabilities.libfooAPI]
  uuid = zxc09z87df890asas?dklfj-w3,j.4324asdf08972342340+89sdfadsf9872etc.
  how = link-against $library-file

Alternatively 'how' could be in libbar. Having it in the package requiring
the capability adds an additional test that the capability is of the
requested form, while having it in the package providing the required
capability allows for alternative implementations. Or perhaps whichever
is first encountered should be used, which allows for user overrides of
autodetected settings, as in the autoconf replacement build system draft
at [1].

'link-against' should be a standard feature of the integrated build
system as well as binary package distribution system, although additional
actions should be definable, e.g. in the form

  [actions.gcc-local.link-against]
  ext-objects = $ext-objects $1

  [actions.gcc-bindist.link-against]
  # nothing

  [actions.bindist.link-against]
  LD_PRELOAD = $LD_PRELOAD:$1

Or perhaps 'how = append LD_PRELOAD $1' etc. for a simpler language.
Also 'how' in the original capability requirement could be defined
separately for different targets. Lots of design decisions still
to be made, and use cases to be researched.. not a one man job
this, really. Few things are, and yet just a handful of people 
with a tunnel vision seem to define the direction of the core
FOSS projects that everyone has to suffer from...

> XFS aka. eXtremely Futile System

So goes life: I never have had a problem with xfs--you
have. The notebook is one and half months old. The desktop
I have too is much older. And it uses xfs as well ... xfs
since I have migrated from reiser4, another very, very
good fs. (I have migrated because of Hans Reiser tragedy
with his wife, you might know about what I am talking;
reiser4 demanded a patch at every kernel release, and the
patches did start to lag behind too much.)

Figure, I have started with reiser3 even with 2.2.x, and
have moved to reiser4 with the first 2.6.x. Brilliant,
superb software!, I virtually never have had problems with
both reiser3 and 4. (Ditto with xfs.)

And believe me, I have unwillingly tested *in vivo*
those fs well. The desktop runs 24/7 ... power outages
permitting [I don't use any UPS longer]. That makes ...?!
one-two power outages a day on the average; with days
having more than ten power outages. (Sumatra belongs also
to the regions in the world where lightnings hit the
most.)

Example: power outage; after two minutes, power is back;
system starts to reboot; after 40 seconds [15 waiting
in LILO] power dies again; after one minute power is
back again; system begins rebooting; 50 seconds later,
peng--next power outage; blackout for one hour; power is
back; all goes well for the next six hours; peng, next
power outage. Etc.

Disagree: xfs, is even more reliable than reiser4 in my
experience. (But I have loved reiser4 very much.)

In a sense you remember me ... have you read The Three
Spinners from the Brother Grimm's Fairy Tales? Voila',
those three strange women, "the first of whom had a broad
flat foot, the second such a great underlip that it hung
down over her chin, and the third had a broad thumb." (And
read the fairy tale to discover why if you don't know
yet.)

You are good. But if you are living ahead others really,
or think so, then learn to accept that: you are walking in
a not much crowded area by definition.

Don't let complaining--just because living in a rarefied
air is hard--become your *professional*, chronic
deformation. There exist many, many other people who have
even more right than you--though for other reasons--to
complain. (But they don't or can't.)

Bah, *selamat tidur* (here it's nearly 03h), and cheers,

If it needs to provide Win32 semantics to remote applications, perhaps
there is.  (I don't know whether the Citrix client uses one local window
for a whole Windows desktop session or for each remote window.)

<snip>

rdesktop also works well for me.  It doesn't want to be resized, but you
can configure its "screen" size to exactly fit the frame.  However, it
doesn't provide any activity indication for remote windows.

And much more broken too. And I really don't have much use for
a bulky laptop.

The only good laptop keyboard I have met, was on a 8086 "suitcase
computer". For the kind of device I'm really after, I actually think
that an integrated keyboard should be dropped. The device would 
normally be used by its touch screen when mobile. It could, however, 
be docked to a keyboard with full-sized keys with full range.

(But not a full-sized keyboard. Modern keyboards are way too bulky,
and getting bulkier with the multimedia shit. The numpad -- which 
makes the right-handed mouse even more painful than it has to be -- 
can be dropped straight off. The cursor keys etc. can also be 
compacted as has been done on some keyboards.)

...

Having read some new information about the OLPC screen, it's worse
than I expected. The monochrome mode is OK, but the colour mode is
an awful blurred hack, because it doesn't have proper pixels: colour
is essentially created by diffracting the backlight into a diagonal
rainbow spectrum, and shutting it off with the monochrome pixels [1].
I probably couldn't stand it (unless the resolution was much higher
than even that in the OLPC). Still, at least it tries to use little
power etc. I'm still waiting for the dual-mode e-paper/colour display...
or the fast colour e-paper display.

Good for you. Or, alternatively, he who laughs last laughs
longest.

I am using xfs since about ?! ...one year, say. (I should
google, can't tell precisely.)

The ambient conditions are those I have described.
Rsnapshot and rsync work nightly, day after day.

(Power outages are less frequent at night on the average,
raining seasons and heavy raining permitting. And if in
that one hour c.ca rsnapshot demands [plus a limited
delay, I use uschedule] there is no power outage, every
morning there is a new snapshot.)

Once every while (order of the week) I pick something
from the daily.x, weekly.x, or monthly.x series of the
snapshots: this, that, and a third thing--not random
exactly, but not always the same stuff nevertheless.

Neither with the snapshots, nor with any other
repositories or disks I have experienced a problem
EVER--so far. (With reiser4 I had to do some recovery of
the fs from time to time.)

Pity for you if you have been xfs-stung, I don't. I will
certainly not stop using xfs because of your ROTFLMAOing.

There is a nice, and humorous short [20-30 lines]
*therapeutic* story on the topic--"what is good for may be
bad for you," and vice versa--by a Persian psychoanalyst.
Can you read German?, the original is in German.

I've installed ion-3rc-20070708 on two machines running FreeBSD with
modular Xorg. The "tabbar" shows questionmarks where i expected the
name of the applicatin running. For the first app i get "???", for
the second "???<1>" and so on.

On another machine running ion-3rc-20070608 everything is just fine.

There appears to be a small typo in recent changes... You can get
around it by selecting a (working) locale/LC_CTYPE, which you should
do in any case.

Ah, thanks! That works here for horizontal panels. What has to be changed
for vertical ones (like dock's "grow" attribute)? Vertical panels seem to
fill the whole screen...

Can't be done, actually. The dock can report its orientation with
region_orientation, but there's no way to manually configure that
information for client windows, for which it isn't otherwise available.

<snip>

I'm the maintainer of the Debian package and should be the first person
you ask about it.  The debian-menu-i18n.lua file is generated
automatically on installation of Ion3 or another package that provides a
menu entry, and is loaded by cfg_ioncore.  It lives in /var/lib/ion3 but
sym-linked from /usr/share/ion3 so that Ion3 can find it.  Please report
the output of:

$ dpkg -l ion3
$ ls -l /usr/share/ion3/debian-menu-i18n.lua
$ ls -l /var/lib/ion3/debian-menu-i18n.lua

I can't answer your other question.

Ben.

Ah. I've noticed another odd thing with this system:

When the pointer is over the panel, the focus is lost. So, when you
launch a program it appears in a floating window instead of being tiled
(unless you move the mouse back to the tiled area quickly before the
window appears).

With the dock, the panel never takes the focus and new windows are always
tiled.

No, the panel gets the focus, because it doesn't have SKIP_FOCUS flag
set, unlike the dock. Hmm... maybe I could make the flag management
more dynamic...

This appears to have solved the tabbar label problem and introduced a  
minor side effect on my installation of ion-3rc-20070708: the F12  
?main menu? system tray input no longer accepts any keystrokes other  
than the ?tab? key. Not a big deal but typing ?<F12> ex <tab>? (for  
auto completion to exit ion3) no longer works (for me).

Probably a user error, or X lib locale support bug. In any case, 
none of the zillion people -- or sock puppets -- that have complained
about this, have been able to tell how to reproduce it.

I've stumbled into the same problem after upgrading, but the remark to 'select a working
locale/LC_CTYPE' escapes me: my locale settings work alright otherwise.

I now tried setting LC_ALL to `C' to see whether for some reason this helps,
but to no avail. 

any help would be appreciated (even if I admit using MacOS which I'm
willing to let be described as crapware (seems right w.r.t. to the
recent no-update-for-statusbar-entries problem) or whatever as long as
someone can tell me how to get the f..ing labels right again).


oh yes, and this: attaching tagged frames did stop working with the previous
release and still is dysfunctional: MOD1+K+A is ignored although the frame is
apparently tagged (check mark and all). attaching via MOD1+A still works.
apart from the usual "MacOS shit" response: any idea (or even confirmation
of the problem) around?

Check any errors that may have showed up on stderr.  I had to change
the function call for attach from WFrame.attach_tagged(_) to
ioncore.tagged_attach(_).

Subject: how to get windows id of tagged "windows"
Message-ID: <873azkggd3.fsf@Queequeg.Pequod>

Hi!

I've wanted to do this for quite some time: I want to sent some keys
(like Page_Up/_Down) to unfocused windows and have found a program to
do it: xvkbd (X virtual keyboard) can send any keysym to any of your
windows. Naturally I'd like to integrate it with ion. My question is:
how to get the XID of a tagged window - so you can tag a window you
want to send your keys to ? 

I've read some of the documentation but could not make much use out of
it (i.e. I know it is the WRegion which is tagged - but how to get from
there to the WClientWin ?).

Thank you!

"the"? rather "a"? By traversing the object tree, of course.

But what you really want is another tagging binding for this purpose,
that is bound on the client window and remembers it, instead of a
container for it.

$ grep 'META.."S"' /usr/local/etc/ion3/cfg_*.lua
/usr/local/etc/ion3/cfg_tiling.lua:    kpress(META.."S", "WTiling.split_at(_, _sub, 'bottom', true)"),

Copy /usr/local/etc/ion3/cfg_tiling to your ~/.ion3 and modify it.

cfg_tiling.lua as a 'grep \"S\" *.lua' in the source etc/ or system-wide
location would have found for you. (So would a grep for split or the
function name in question, in case future keys aren't "" bracketed.)

No, do not copy random system files into ~/.ion3 only copy cfg_ion.lua,
cfg_statusbar.lua, and cfg_dock.lua. Leave the rest in the system
locations and override the bindings in cfg_ion.lua or in any other file
you want as long as you dopath("") it from cfg_ion.lua.
