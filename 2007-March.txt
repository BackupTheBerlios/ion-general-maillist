If you take this a little further and have the tags in a hierarchy I
think you could solve quite a few of the problems.  If you view the
directories in a traditional file system as tags and the files being
allowed being allowed to appear, several times, in any directory (think
hardlinks) then you're pretty much there already.  What would be nice
would be to tag a file as being associated with a directory but without
actually being in it and therefore needing a unique name within it.  It
would also be nice to be able to do the translation back again from file
to find out what names it appears under in the file system.

If we view it as Haskell code, we have a set of Tags that can either be
the root of a hierarchy or appear below another tag with a name,

> data Tag = Root | Tag String Tag

and a set of Objects.

> data Object = Object

Once we have these, we can implement the standard Unix calls:

> readdir :: Tag -> [Object]
> open :: Tag -> String -> Object
> link :: Tag -> Object -> String -> ()
> unlink :: Tag -> String -> ()

Plus the more interesting ones specific to this file system

> tag :: Tag -> Object -> ()
> untag :: Tag -> Object -> ()
> bindings :: Object -> [(Tag, Maybe String)]

Rather than just the intersection of tags, how about using a finite
state automaton (similar to a regexp, but over the names in the tag
hierarchy rather than characters) for searching.  It's the first
formalisation I could come up that seemed as though it would be
generally useful.  The purpose is to allow you to express things like:

  Show me all the files that are tagged with both "projects/sysfs" and
  "people/sam_mason".

  Show me all the files that are tagged with either "people/sam_mason"
  or "people/tuomo_valkonen".

  Show me all the files that are "bound with a name" in a tag that ends
  with "bin" or "sbin".

Here is my best attempt at a grammar (of the syntax) for specifying this
sort of thing, it's mainly based on a grammar for regular expressions.
Specifying this sort of thing at the level of characters is a bit cheesy
but seems to be reasonably standard practice.

This would allow you to specify the above examples as:

  projects/sysfs&people/sam_mason

  people/sam_mason|people/tuomo_valkonen

  (bin|sbin)$

It would be possible to use '/' for either the Root or Leaf, but if
people accidentally put an extra '/' into the string it would do
strange things.  It's for this reason that I've left the root and leaf
identifiers the same a regular expressions.

I didn't bother to read all the technical explanation in detail,

after a more complex system, where all tags are merely informational,
meta-data, whereas in my system the tags are the identity. My system
merely removes the order of path elements from the traditional file 
system, whereas in your system files have "flat" organisation, and 
they can be tagged in various (ordered?) ways for searching, and 
uniqueness of file names has to be enforced separately from tagging.
(How else do you provide persistent search results? That's a key
component in my system: persistency of locations. Adding new files
does not stop a known path from working for opening a particular file.)

Or otherwise you're just unnecessarily distinguishing that file name.
In doesn't seem like what I'm after at all.

Oh, and one thing I very much want is sub-files, or nodes 
working as both directories and files. (Although with pure 
set-based addressing instead of mapping to the unix VFS, the
concept of a directory makes no sense.) How would your system
do that neatly? Make a tag with the same name as the file?
It would seem to me that things would quickly get complicated...

To avoid further confusions, a clarifying example is perhaps
in order:

Suppose we're dealing with two files, e.g. the README files for 
Ion, and, say, gcc. On a traditional hierarchical FS, we might 
store these as

	ion/README
	gcc/README

and these paths would be the unique identifiers of these files. 
But we could just as well have chosen

	README/ion
	README/gcc

You can of course have both by symlinking, but it gets cumbersome.
The solution: setfs, removing the order from identies. A file
is not identified by an (ordered) sequence of strings/tags, but an
(unordered) set of them.

Now, both of these files also have additional data associated with
them: the author of Ion and ion/README is me, Tuomo Valkonen, the 
authorfc gcc/README is someone else. Both files have some creation
dates, and so on. Some of this data could be considered to be "tags"
(say, tuomov.author), and some of it not (the creation time). But
this information is not really essential to the "identity" of the
file. It's merely meta-data. That is not something that a basic 
version of setfs would deal with, and it something not to be had
in the identity of the file. 

Now, setfs could of course support meta-data, but it has to be done
in a peculiar manner, so that the unique identifier can be easily
picked out from the path. I have thought to reserve path elements
beginning with a '#' symbol for that (so that identifying tags can
not begin with the symbol). For example: the path
'#author:tuomov/ion/README' clearly indicates, that 'ion' and
'README' are the _persistent_ identifying tags, and '#author:tuomov'
is merely a meta-data filter used for searching the file, and __can
be ignored by non-search functions__. Likewise, you could support
'or'ing meta-data for searches: for example, the result from the
search '#author:tuomov|project:gcc/README' could list the tags 'ion'
and 'gcc' -- and still we could get the persistent identifier for
both results by dropping the '#author:tuomov|project:gcc' term.
(Meta-data filters with an 'and' in them can simply '/#' instead
of '|', since the terms in the path are 'anded'.)

Hard links are also possible: you just give two different tag sets
to a file. However, you can't just 'or' the search for such 
identifier tag sets directly: you must still use the special 
syntax to be able to pick out the persistent parts of the result.
So suppose the same file had two identifying sets of tag 'foo/bar'
and 'baz/quk'. Then you might make the search '#tag:foo/#tag:bar',
and this might return both 'foo/bar' and 'baz/quk'. Yes, either
'foo' or 'bar' is in a sense "twice" for both results, but the
other instance is encoded in a manner that indicates a search 
filter that is not part of the identity of the result.

So, you see, basic setfs is about identity, not meta-data.
It is about providing persistent human-readable identifiers
to files (unlike a basic meta-data -based database file system),
without a constraining hierarchy (unlike traditional file 
systems). Meta-data/filters/informational tags is something 
else that can be had on top of that, but is not the fundamental
principle behind setfs: partial order instead of total order is.

And to conclude my monologue here, I want to note that there's
nothing specific to setfs about the '#filter' hacks I described
in the previous posting: they could be supported and implemented
by any traditional file system, or a higher level library or VFS
component -- even an additional indexing database service on top
of a traditional FS or SetFS -- although some filters may be most 
efficient to implement at the FS level. But lacking more general
support mechanisms for the filters, they can be implemented in
a SetFS fuse module for SetFS alone, but largely independently 
of the core functionality of SetFS.

I thought it would be nice to have something concrete to discuss, but it
was probably a bit early!

I guess I have ended up somewhere quite different from where we started,
yes.  I moved away from your idea of a flat namespace for tags mainly
because I don't think it'll scale well.  I did a "find -type f" in
my home directory and went through giving tags to all the files and
surprisingly quickly started hitting places where files would get the
same set of tags or I would have to give files unnecessary tags to make
naming work.  The tags also started to get increasingly byzantine names
as I worked my way down the hierarchy and I can't see any way for this
not to happen.

I think those are the main reasons that I adopted a hierarchy for the
tags.  Once I'd got them I pulled all the features back I could from our
previous discussions and ended up at the idea I sent.

The main point of departure from your system, as far as I can tell, is
that I only use a single binding (tag,name) is used to identify a file
where as you only want the set of tags to identify a file.  You try much
harder to make the existing Unix interface with the system, but I don't
think this difference is as important.

The main reason I use a single tag, rather than a file's complete set of
tags, is because a file's tags will change over time (I think) yet in
the face of this change we want file names to remain working.

> (How else do you provide persistent search results? That's a key

I view search results as just that, the result of a search.  Searching
again at a later date *will* return different results and I don't think
it's sensible to try too hard to make it too stable.  If a file can be
located through just one tag I think naming will be much more tolerant
to change.

> Or otherwise you're just unnecessarily distinguishing that file name.
> In doesn't seem like what I'm after at all.

The file name does become special for me, but I couldn't see any other
way to keep the other properties.


I don't know if I've moved too far away from your idea for the
differences to be reconciled, I hope I haven't and we can bring things
back together again.

In a metadata DB FS, files don't have names that we can talk about.
We can only search for them in various ways, and point at the found
objects.

I think you're much closer to the usual metadata-based DB file 
systems than my approach, especially as you don't care about 
persistent search results, which is fundamental to my idea: if
I didn't care about them, any metadata-based DB FS might do it.
But having to use some arcane (numeric) identifiers for persistent 
access to files instead of their paths drifts too much away from 
unixland into WIMPland. Now, there could be advantages to working
with abstract objects intead of paths, and maybe nice command line
interfaces could be designed for that, but it's not going to happen
in such a time scale that setfs can be implemented in. It would take
decades. So I want something that works with existing tools: setfs.

I think you're also still confusing the notion of a tag on setfs,
and meta-data tag: you're thinking too much in terms of providing
lots of description (metadata) for a file, and too little in terms
of simply removing the order from unix path names, and providing a
non-hierarchical identity. Yes, deciding on an identity for a file
can demand a bit of effort, and it is not always clear, but it 
should be easier to decide on an non-hierarchical identity than a
hierarchical one in at least some use cases. I think organisation
of random notes could be one of those, and that's why I want to try
this in riot.

I was just rereading this thread and that just clicked for me as well,
Most of the information I wanted to attribute is meta-data.  A few times
when I was thinking about this I was wondering who was going to bother
entering all this information and I'm still not sure.  One hierarchy can
be bad and I'm not entirely sure if several would be better.  I would
like to think it would though!

Yes, I think you are right here.  It would be a very powerful
organisational tool for this sort of thing, I can imagine some very good
interfaces based on this concept.  In terms of using it as a general
file system, I'm not sure how well it would scale (in human terms of
coming up with meaningful tags) past a few thousand objects/files.

One needs to experiment. The hierarchical FS does also have a 
scalability problem to huge amounts of data. No single naming
scheme can resolve that well: you need some kind of search
functionality for lots of data. But you still want to be able
to give meaningful names/identies to many things as well. At 
least I do.

Come to think of it, perhaps people are going the wrong way
about database file systems: implementing them on top of a
conventional FS, giving useless names to the files under the
database file system's control. Perhaps it would be better
to have at the bottom an unorganised data store with only
abstract identies for objects, and then have additional 
systems on top of that providing names to things that need
them: traditional hierarchical, setfs-style, whatever fits
the application. Files could have names in multiple systems,
and Not every file would need to have an identity in any of 
these systems (except one providing access to the files with
the meaningless identifiers in an uniform manner). They would
have to be found through an indexing service, and possibly 
given meaningful names in one of the naming systems if needed.

I fully agree that primarily mouse driven interfaces are generally
not very expressive.  There are a few classes of problem that are
expressed well with a mouse, that of drawing programs or navigating a 3D
environment, but mice seem to be used more and more for lots of things
that I don't think naturally fit---graphical programming languages are
one of these for me.

The counter argument is that mice are more accessible and GUIs easier
to learn.  I personally don't think this is a valid argument.  GUIs
are even more powerful when combined with keyboard access as well as a
mouse, and being easier to learn has nothing to do with the fact that
the program is graphical.

I don't think this comment was aimed at my idea but one of the things I
was aiming for was to keep persistent file names in my system, I think
it should provide same naming capabilities as a traditional Unix style
file system.  I haven't seen many database filesystems, but those that I
have haven't provide useful persistent identifiers.

And how do you ensure that every program can interact with every file?

Capability Systems provide a very good way through a pattern that has
started to be known as the "powerbox", plash[1] is an implementation for
GNU/Linux that looks as though it can replace the GTK file-open dialog
with one that would return a "capability" to the file rather than its
name.  It would be possible to extend this idea and make the plash file
chooser aware of different ways of finding files.

Mounting the naming system somewhere in the global namespace?
Or maybe URL-style stuff, if we didn't have to stick to the unix
namespace (which we would): setfs://foo/bar/

> Capability Systems 

Of course, supposing all files are not in a global namespace, 
a private namespace is a capability system: to give a program 
an access to a file, the program giving the capability would 
map it in the requesting program's namespace and naming system
(at a requested location). 

But I'm not to keen on namespaces private to processes...

URLs are only useful for opening a file when you know the name.  I
wouldn't like to type complete filenames (with all path elements)
each time I wanted to open a file.  Things like tab completion and
working directory only really work when you have something with similar
semantics to a hierarchical file system and can afford to expose the
interface.

If you have to work with namespaces then this is about all you can do.
Inside a real capability system you would just ask something (the GUI
normally) to interact with the user and give you back a capability
(similar semantics to a "reference" in programming terms) to the file(s)
the user selected.

> But I'm not to keen on namespaces private to processes...

Capability systems generally don't imply private namespaces, it's just
the only obvious way to implement this sort of thing under Linux.

The concept of a directory does not really apply, but SetFS can 
(obviously) have a "working set", tab-completion, and so on.

No, capability systems as you put it, only imply hanging onto what
you see. But you need to give things some identifiers for the user
to be able to talk about them to the system. You need namespaces.
A capability system without names is useless. Dragging&dropping
random icons presenting the objects between programs to give them
access to things is totally impractical, totally unusable. You need
names that you can just input, without laborously looking up the 
object -- as is the WIMP approach. Whether every program has direct
access to global namespaces, or whether they need to query some 
other program that only sees the namespace (going to be a _lot_
of work to support various kinds of UIs!), for both the object and
the name to talk about, is irrelevant to that.

	Is there any way to change the name of the directory that ion3 uses for 
the session configuration information, short of editing ioncore.c?  I 
tried adjusting my DISPLAY environment variable but I couldn't come up 
with anything it liked.  Currently, I've hacked ioncore_init_session to 
also include the contents of the HOST environment variable, but that is 
probably not so secure in the long term.

Fix your X setup to include it in DISPLAY. Or RTFM (-session).

Is it really a good idea ?

Changing from ":0" to "host:0" on a local display results in using
interface lo instead of a unix socket, and therefore performance loss.

If that is so, fixing it is just a matter of small optimisation in the
libraries... and you realy should have that host name there in a
networked environment.

Actually, the N800 is rather small compared to what I was after, and
I'd call the N800 a PDA. What I'm after, is somewhere between that
and the UMPCs (that, however, are too big for the size of the screen).

In any case, someone did once write a patch for the N700, but I never
got a proper darcs patch bundle, so it never got into Ion. I can't be
bothered applying and documenting plain-old-diffs that I have no
particular interest in (although am not opposed to including).

My understanding is that using the loopback interface is the desired
behavior if your DISPLAY contains the hostname. You might actually
want this for debug, profiling, ... and the argument is that if you
don't want this, then DISPLAY=:0.0 is the way to do it.

Message-ID: <slrneuqea3.sv7.tuomov@jolt.modeemi.cs.tut.fi>

I'm sick of distributions providing ancient development snapshots, that
their lusers think is the latest, and come crying to me about. Since
Debian appears to refuse [1,2] to remove the ancient Ion3 development
snapshot that they have (20061223, the last release with totally broken
Xinerama support) from the new static (so called "stable") distribution,
I will be refusing to deal with the average Debian luser, just like I 
can't be bothered to deal with the average Gentoo luser. Sucks though 
that already filtering out these lusers from the complaining masses is
a lot of work. Sucks that the first question to everyone must be "which
version and distro you're using" -- and it's usually the people who've 
installed Ion from a distribution, that are using old unsupported 
development snapshots. (Actually, maybe I should just stop supporting
anyone who has not installed Ion from the official tarball. Let the 
distros support their own lusers.)

I'm also considering extending the license (LGPL) with a "Distributor
timely response clause", something like the following (D). It could
make Ion "non-free", but I don't care about these idealists' definitions
of freeness.

  D. Anyone distributing Ion3 in aggregate with other works, must
     within twenty-eight (28) days from the release of a new version
     of Ion3, either (A) upgrade the aggregate to include the new
     version, and cause the new version be installed when a user tries
     to install an unspecified version of Ion3, or upgrade Ion3 (from the
     aggregate); or (B) remove Ion3 from the aggregate, and notify users
     of the removal, when they try to upgrade the aggregate or Ion3 (from
     the aggregate) and have installed an old version of Ion3. (It is,
     however, not necessary to remove Ion3 from the user's computer;
     merely notify of its out-datedness.)

     The requirements above on responses to user actions do not apply,
     if the user is not network-connected, or chooses not to use network
     installation, and is using physical distribution media.

     This clause does not bind any rebranded derivative works, that can
     not be confused with Ion3: that is, any derivative work whose name
     can not be confused with "Ion3", and which in in no way points
     to the original work or its authors for support, may be distributed
     under the LGPL or GPL without this clause.

(Perhaps this should be combined with a clause that forbids 
distributors from applying unsupported/unapproved patches... 
like Xft... Too bad that due to the nature of Gentoo ebuilds, 
it probably doesn't work against them.)

Too bad that Ion3 is going into a freeze too soon, so that the
benefit of the clause would be minimal, as it doesn't work
retroactively. But if that wasn't the case, I'd certainly add it.
I'm sick of sloppy distributors and mega-frozen distributions, 
and the lusers who think they're using the latest version because
of them.

I must admit I recently switched to dwm, which is a really light wm.

I still use riot, waiting for any new improvements!

Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that real users compile everything from source -- 
just Ion.  I myself use both Debian unstable and Ubuntu.  I only compile things 
from scratch if they are programs that I really care about and that aren't 
current enough in the distros.

I will totally agree on the "debian is always 3 years out of date"
issue (TRUST me, I feel the pain daily), but I have to disagree
strongly with the above statement. It doesn't matter how competent you
are, you do NOT want to maintain thousands of programs manually unless
you have nothing better to do in your life than managing said
programs.

If I want a newer version, assuming I'm not stuck on Debian, it's
easier to just update the port/pkgsrc package and compile from that,
than to keep compiling maunally from source with all the
deinstall/upgrade hell it entails.

and then, maybe not. 

I don't think this attitude is helpful. what's the sense
of this? AFAICS `ion3' is a very useful WM, i.e. a tool (repeat together: A TOOL). 
as far as I understand the ion home page the whole point was to create a better
user (repeat: USER) interface. 
not for everyone, certainly, but for a non-negligible fraction of the
people who need a WM (i.e. those who are sitting in front of some unix box).

arguing against distros and/or package management systems seems bizarre to me.

maybe neither wise to interfere nor of relevance to you but anyway:

sure, you are not overreacting a bit? having strong opinions I like and getting
angry at stupidity (or what one thinks is stupidity -- not necessary the same
thing) I understand (happens to me, too), but
a 'take no prisoners' approach is too much for me. whatever and whoever might
have got on your nerves: a 12 weeks old version is "ancient"?  if that version
is broken, that's bad and it should not be in the distro (and maybe no
longer at the homepage for download?) but than I would argue
that it might have been better in the first place to do the usual thing and
to clearly identify/discriminate a "stable version" (which should
go in the distros and "development snapshots" (which everyone might download
from the home page and compile/test). as far as I can see, `ion3' is simply
flagged as "development" at the home page. so what is a poor guy wanting to
include `ion3' in a distro to do? what would have prevented to identify some
intermediate version as "sufficiently stable" for average use?  sure, it's not
your responsibility to do this and it's not your problem if the debian/gentoo
people have somehow managed to include the wrong `ion3' version, but sweeping
the shotgun in a 360 deg. circle in this way??

or maybe forbid the use of `ion3' altogether? come on. tell you what: I'm
writing this while running ion3ds-20060524 which happens to lie around at the macports
site because some nice guy added it to that package management system.
suits me fine. if I'm not content, sure I can download the official tarball and
see whether I get it installed. fact is: I have work to do and the trade off
between having the latest&greatest and simply use what's there is easy for me at
the moment. you want to force the guys to upgrade their system every few weeks
or remove `ion3' altogether?  mmh. could serve as a strategy to ensure that ion
users know each other personally in a few years.

If only everyone bothered to compile the package from source when on
ancient Debian, instead of trying the old development snapshot they 
provide, and then complaining.

And, yeah, I also can't be bothered compiling software myself, except
a few rare ones. But for the bulk of it, even source based distros 
demand too much in my experience. Debian sucks, but everything else
sucks just as much, in other ways. Debian could easily suck a bit
less, if they only froze a stable base system, and instead spent more 
effort on backports.org.

Even I you don't care about it I wanted to say I fully agree with
Joerg. I'm sorry I have asked stupid outdated newbie questions when
you once broke the API and my ion didn't work as before. It certainly
pissed you off but that is why others have answered with a short RTFM
and its reference... Ion is *really* cool and I cannot think about
using another window manager for the next few years. I've been using
debian for ten years now and even if I don't always like the way it
works, it still serves me way better than any other distro. But you
probably agree with that as well.

I know users are a pain in the ass to developpers but my point is:
debian maintainers are volunteers and spend their time where they can
afford to and where they like it. By acting like that, I think the
ion3 package will soon disappear from debian. And I don't think anyone
else will volunteer soon given the way it ended... You make it look
like you anyway want ion3 out of debian but I think this is a loss.
Whatever you decide, it won't change anything to me, but still... it
would suck.

People should not include unstable/development software in "stable"
distros. I'm not that annoyed with 20061223 being available now, but
with the new "stable" Debian still providing it when people ask for
"ion3", two years from now, as seems likely to be the case. So from
two years from now, you still have to deal with lusers complaining
about it.

Debian/unstable does tend to normally have the latest release quite
quickly, except now, that they've freezen it too, and you already get
complaints from people using "the latest" -- in Debian. Gentoo, OTOH,
only sporadically update their ebuilds, and they don't seem to have
a proper maintainer either.. They seem to take the package directly
from the home page, however, so I can just remove the old ones...
And although occasionally you get some Gentoo user using some very
old locked version (well, not recently anymore, actually), most 
often the user complaining of an old development snapshot, is a 
Debian or Ubuntu user.

You use whatever version you want and works for you, but if you don't use
the latest, stop complaining about any bugs and other glitches. Distros,
however, should provide the latest or deal themselves with the lusers 
ignorant of the fact that they're not using the latest and should thus 
keep their mouths shut. At the very least they should warn with das big
red blinkenletters that what they're using is old, to stay away from the
upstream, and provide the support themselves. Nobody forces any user to
upgrade something that works for them: the distro could easily ask if 
you want to upgrade to an incompatible version instead of doing it 
automagically. And I wish they did that, instead of breaking the system,
like Debian often does. But if you don't use the latest, be aware that 
you get no support, and are on your own.

I don't provide development snapshots with the intent of having to
support them years from now, which seems to be Debian's idea of
the matter.

As if I wasn't a volunteer too. I spent my time where I want, 
and that doesn't include supporting lusers using the ancient

Of course you are. I just think it is obvious enough to avoid adding a
lame "(just like you)" after the volunteer laius.

All I'm saying is, imho, you'd better ignore lusers rather than
shutting everything off and thus preventing new users to come to ion
and existing users to keep up (with some delay...) with the latest
ion. Decreasing the size of your mailbox size does not seem worth it
to me. But it's your mailbox after all, not mine... :)

Like I said: every prophet in his house. Do whatever you want, it
won't change my life. I'll keep using ion and debian and probably will
compile from the cvs only when I realize I'm getting too far away from
your development version (that you were about to stop working on I
thought or at least really slow down). I just think you're making a
weird choice... but it's yours after all! ;)

Cheers,

     Arnaud

One thing that I don't like is people just silently ignoring you if 
you contact them personally, and have a question. In this age of 
spam, you don't know where the message ended up. So I rather
let people know that I will be ignoring them.

I don't like it either and that is not exactly what I suggested. I was
talking about emails sent on the mailing list. Even if you're the one
who created the ion-general mailing list, those mails are not sent to
you personnaly. As far as I'm concerned, when I get a private email on
a software I'm involved on, my answer is always "Please, use the user
mailing list". One can then easily check whether the mail was received
on the mailing list or not... Then others who may have more time to
answer to newbie question can do it for me, which gives me more time
to answer "real" questions.

It's still extra work to do that redirection, and one thing I also
don't like is having to subscribe on a mailing list... but since
mailing list software/providers suck, it's the only weapon against 
spam.

Your first reference (the Debian bugreport) seems to have been updated
in between. The bug is now "serious", and I think this means the
package will be removed from testing (and therefore the future stable)
after some time unless someone closes the bug (2 weeks IIRC).

That seems to be a good solution: people using unstable can use a
reasonably recent snapshot, and this eliminates the worst-case senario
of someone complaining about broken Xinarema in 200612xx in 2010.

And there's always backports.org... the use of which is, however, too
poorly documented; and when I asked around, nobody seemed to know to
automate updates from there (for only the packages specifically 
installed from there).

This is imho the best of the options. A smalled canned reply like:
"Sorry, I only have time and inclination to support my latest development
snapshot. If you can recreate the bug on latest ion3, please report
back. Else report to bugs.debian.org."

Users who want to stick with distro-supplied stuff, knowing full well
it is ancient, will know what to do. Users who want their problems fixed
will know what to do.

Thanks

And updates will only happen to packages installed from there. 

But you managed to lose the debian maintainer with your attitude and several
debian users. Congratulations.

The less users, the better. Users a problem: they make demands, requests,
and complaints. I just want to finish this shit and forget about it. 

Oh, and I could say a few words of someone's attitude of passing
the ball to a yet if ever existent volunteer, instead of doing what
needs to be done. But maybe I won't.

No. 
Just don't use pinning but apt-get -t sarge-backports install <package>.

From thereon everything will happen automatically. Just read the whole
documentation.

The whole documentation? That single page? It says nothing of future
'apt-get upgrade's upgrading <package> from backports. And when I 
tried to find out ages ago, nobody knew how to achieve that...
And I'm on 'testing', for now, so trying it out is a bit difficult.

> Maybe you shouldn't publish any software then?

The problem is that the mistake has already been made, and all you
can do now, is minimise the damage.

I use slrn/NNTP/Gmane for most of my lists, BTW, and have disabled 
receiving the emails. I'd prefer not having to subscribe either, or
the subscription (and disabling of receiving mail) being queried
in response to a posting when not subscribed. (gmane, in fact, does
already try to verify that you really are there and not just a rooted
spam bot, before it lets you post... but the lists don't know that.)
It would also be great to be able to subscribe to just the single
thread that you start -- automatically.

One user is enough. I don't need the zillion kids for whom Ion is the
latest shiny gadget to be dumped when the next one comes along.

Tuomo,
I am consistently astounded by your attitude towards users of ion.

You have actually written a well thought out, very useful, piece of  
software.  The kind of people who are going to be using ion are those who  
work in an "alternative" (we know WIMP is crap, but it is the standard)  
fashion.  My guess is that this bunch of people are also the most likely  
to want to have "alternative" setups and otherwise customise the tool they  
use to get real work done.

However your comments appear to suggest that everyone should work exactly  
like you:

I don't like xinerama therefore:
  - noone could possibly justify the use of a pair of monitors (or heaven  
forbid even more)

I don't want to support month old releases therefore:
  - everyone should be constantly updating to the latest snapshot. And in  
fact compiling that from source - because as far as I can tell you haven't  
been bothered to make an interim 'stable' ion3 for people to settle on.   
In fact I don't think I've ever seen a 'stable' version since I started  
using ion3. How can debian et al. include ion3 at all if you never release  
a stable version?

I don't want to to subscribe to a mailing list...
  - no mailing lists subscriptions ?? wtf? how are you going to get the  
email - would you prefer to use a newsgroup or a bulletin board / forum?  
Mailing lists need subscription so you can see what's being talked about.

The less users, the better. Users are a problem...
  - They are also the point of software - without them software is useless.

For someone who seems to have a reasonable grasp of what makes a decent  
WM, and what user interfaces should be like (which of course depends  
primarily on the user) you present an incredibly arrogant face to the  
world -  something which you may or may not realise.

Don't get me worng I still think ion is a great WM, but you seem to have a  
very odd mental block with regard to people.

John

PS - still using 3ds-20051029 - xinerama support is important to me - and  
this has never really failed me (although I have got an interesting bug at  
the moment, the scratchpad is far smaller than it used to be on my work  
machine...)

One should not completely trust the popular press, though. The
original reference may be (http://www.it-environment.org/compenv.html),
and the quote there says:

"""
Manufacturing computers is materials intensive; the total fossil fuels used
to make one desktop computer weigh over 240 kilograms, some 10 times the
weight of the computer itself. This is very high compared to many other
goods: For an automobile or refrigerator, for example, the weight of fossil
fuels used for production is roughly equal to their weights. Also,
substantial quantities of chemicals (22 kg), and water (1,500 kg) are also
used. The environmental impacts associated with using fossil fuels (e.g.
climate change), chemicals (e.g. possible health effects on microchip
production workers) and water (e.g. scarcity in some areas) are significant
and deserve attention.
"""

So the amount of fossil fuels used would be more like 1/5:th that of 
a car, which is still by no means a small number. However, this number
does not seem to be the energy used: 1000kg of fossil fuels is not even
comparable the amount a car burns in its lifetime, and as I said, the 
energy in that is comparable to the energy used in the production of 
a car. So it could be that the press got their number from elsewhere 
in the book, or that the number has not even been calculated.

in itself a fair excuse for not supporting it, but not a good reason to

Actually I have had my current pair of monitors for 5 years - the pair I  
had before that are now in use at church office (pastor and secretary),  
having now had a useful life of around 10 years and counting*. My graphics  
card is about 7 years old, the rest of the machine ~4 I think (with no  
immediate plans to upgrade)

I don't think I count as a "techno-toy fetishist", just someone who can  
see more than the <1 steradian occupied by a single screen at a sensible  
distance in front of me**.


John

* Actually as I had one of them for a couple of years before the other  
that's proably an aggregate of 11 years - I used my old 14"CRT with the  
shiny 17" CRT for a good while - the 14" screen still finds itself stuck  
in my loft for occasional use.

** Have you read the "anti-mac" interface article  
(http://acm.org/cacm/AUG96/antimac.htm) - basically decrying WIMP  
interfaces as a regression in terms of limiting us to pointing and  
grunting at things we can see.  I feel the same about having to wear  
blinkers when I'm working, why did I bother with eyes that can see a  
decent space in front of me?

it's starting to seem you might be one of them, actually. that's getting
ridiculous and/or annoying rapidly (accelatering at about 9.81 m/s^2: you are in
free fall). lucky thing, ion3 is more sensible and consistent than your

I get the impression Tuomo tries to ged rid of ion's users - pardon,
lusers in most cases. And he does it in his, let's say very outspoken,
way. But readers of this list/newsgroup should by now be used to it,
shouldn't they ?

By the way, there are other window managers out there...  (I myself

If you would bother to revisit the original discussion and the 
FAQ entry, the fact that multihead is most of the time unecological
penis enlargement, with no real justifiable (to me) need behind 
it, was essential to it. There are other things to consider besides
the "comfort" of having the biggest screen (penis) in the block
(or even the environment). Too bad most people don't seem see 
further than that, and engage in mindless consumerism.

Um..  I use two heads (although I keep one of them switched off when i'm not 
using it).  One head is my laptop screen, the other is the monitor from my 
old desktop machine.

For a simple reason - compartmentifying my desktop.  In fact, I use two 
monitors for exactly the same reason I use ion.  I can split the desktop into 
two - keep mail/irc/IM/web browsing to one screen whilst concentrating on my 
work on the other.

The dimensions of two screens simply work better.  Unless someone feels like 
making an ultra-widescreen monitor, 4:3 and 16:9 always leave me with unused 
corners, when I could simply split things in half.  In general, I always have 
two windows in most active use at any one time.

That would be the "norepinephrine" neurotransmitter from the locus ceruleus.

damn, I should really better stick with my recent resolution and keep off, but I
can't: you can say your last half-sentence again, at least (where "most people"
quite obviously does apply to only rather a few countries, "most people" in
others having quite different problems than "mindless consumerism"). the rest
remains pointless (to me, that is: and good to see this parenthesis from you,
for one, too). I don't want and don't need multi-head (or only very seldom,
when plugging in a second display to my labtop), and you are probably right that
most of the time it's only playing around, but hey: let "them" play. as long as
that keeps "them" from jetting around the whole planet for a short holiday,
that's fine with me. and sure there are niches where double head display
sometimes makes sense (e.g. tomographic imaging in medicine). anyway, it's
simply not worth the fuss to argue against it in your sub-amok fashion. the
planet sure has more pressing problems, cars not the least, and energy and
resource consumption (and their effects) in general the most important of them.
but all of them are boiling down to the fact that the ecosystem won't tolerate
much longer such a large population. which is not to say that personal
responsibility is not an issue, but then it's better to concentrate on the main
culprits (cars, travel, air conditioning, short buy/throw away cycles etc etc).

I was talking about the user visible side.
it does what it should, navigation/control is consistent and well designed, 
it's fast and without crashes/hangs. it's helpful. how it looks under the hood
is a different question.

That's a relatively reasonable setup, since there can be proper 
need for a portable computer, but the screen on such a device 
is a bit smallish for any real work (assuming a real laptop and
not a 17" dragtop).

But let's not get into this Xinerama discussion again. I can not
be bothered supporting it, and if someone wants it, he'll just
have to write a module that generates a suitable setup... 
possibly fixing Ion itself as well. 

(But might I remind, that Xinerama is not the only option for 
multihead on X.)

1. As long as you stay out of my sight, use whatever version you 
   wish. I don't care.

2. But if you want my help, or otherwise come complaining within my
   sight, you'd better be using or have tried things out on a supported
   release, i.e. the latest release on a supported "branch". (Ion3 or 
   Ion2; Ion1 available merely as a historical curiosity. Ion2 support
   will also cease when "stable" Ion3 is released. Not that there's 
   been much of a need to support it.)

3. Distros should provide only supported releases (with a reasonable
   delay, which two years isn't), or at the very least let users know 
   (in a manner that they can not ignore) when they're installing an 
   unsupported release. 

   The reasons are simple: a) if your distro is supposedly "stable", it
   is easy for you to think that the software it provides is "stable"
   too, and hence supported. b) And if your distro supposedly provides
   the latest software, of course you assume that the program you just
   installed is the latest. But it sometimes isn't. (This latter has
   seldom been a problem with Debian, thankfully. It was at some time
   with Gentoo, but I suppose nobody uses the ebuilds anymore.)

That sounds almost scary... I will not try to imagine how that really  
works... I use only one head, and try to keep it switched on all the time

That said, and as a personal note: I use two monitors at work, and don't  
think it is because some "techno-toy fetishism", but rather because it  
significantly eases my work. But I concur that Xinerama adds a lot of  
complexity and hacks where the only thing you might want is to drag a  
window from one screen to the other. But I can live very well without  
that, and I make use of no Xinerama (even if I'd not be running ion3,  
which incidentall, I find an excellent WM suiting all my needs - thanks  
Tuomo! (I missed the thanks in the recent eulogy thread))

The bug has been downgraded from "serious" to "important". Also
judging from the discussion there, it is starting to seem that 
Debian is not going to do anything, after all. The license change
therefore seems highly likely again. If they want to distribute
ancient releases, I'll take the new ones away from them.

Subject: xdm, pager (less) ion-manual page viewing
Message-ID: <20070311020131.GA6015@jurjen.lan>

Hello, what is the difference between starting X with xdm and with startx?  When
i start X with the startx command, the pager which displays the manuals works as
it should, but when i start ion with xdm the pager (less) exits after it gets to
the last line, which is annoying if the page is smaller then 1 screen, because i
can't read that fast.

My .xsession and .xinit both end with these lines:
/usr/X11R6/bin/ion3 &
xmms &
xterm -name main &
exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -name login

I don't have any less-environment or config options on and couldn't find anywhere
if xdm changes some of those. So i don't understand why the pager behaves differently
after i start X with xdm.

-greetings, jurjen

note: with pager i mean the pager that gets opened with the mod_query.query_man()

HACK:
Put export PAGER=less in your xinit.

Or better look how the xinit of your distribution is set up. Or  
better exec your system-xinit-script at the last line of our own  
xinit. (use exec not the plain command)

startx inhertis the environment of your login shell.
xdm does nit. xdm sets up its own onvornment.

. $home/.profile or . /etc/profile
or
. $HOME/.bashrc
would probably help. The later is not really the right way because it  
is only meant to set the shell environment.


The esence of my answer is. Check what your distro does in xinit and  
do it the distro-way. ;)


PS: Debian uses the alternatives system. Check update-alternatives

"Which version" has always been a critical field for bug reports.  Even
if you expect everyone to compile from the latest source, they're still
not going to do it every day.

My understanding is that a Debian maintainer must at the absolute
*minimum* provide first-line support to Debian users.

Please don't do this.  We'd have to come up with some funny new name,
possibly involving the word "ice".

Hello everybody.  I've agreed to adopt the Debian packages of ion3, but
have not yet made any changes to them.

I'm quite happy to include a clear notice that bugs and queries should
be reported to me as the maintainer rather than you.  However, this is
what users should do for any package, and there's not much I can do
about (l)users that don't know about reportbug or how to find the
maintainer's email address.  They probably won't read the Debian
documentation either.

ion3 has been removed from the testing suite and will not be included in
the etch release.

I agree, actually; I think Debian has very variable levels of support
for released packages and this is not made clear to users.  Since you
say ion3 is not in a state to be supported for the lifetime of a Debian
release, I must accept that.  Therefore I will try to keep it up-to-date
in unstable and backports.

>    b) And if your distro supposedly provides the latest software,

No-one accuses Debian of that, surely? ;-)

They don't read any documentation. That's why you have to to throw
it on their faces... somehow the initial welcome messages of Ion
also seems to be ignored by many, however. But at least you won't
get new lusers complaining of old already resolved problems, or 
features that have changed significantly, if you provide them with
the latest version. People have already used a program for some 
time, would seem more likely to check if they have the latest, than
someone just installing it.

Unstable and testing are close enough.

It's not only bug reports; it's all support that you need the version 
for in Ion. And sometimes it may be difficult to get the version from
the luser. They're just using "the latest", or "just installed it".

Maybe I won't... for Ion3 yet, since it's reaching stability. 
But as for other projects, maybe. There has to be some way to
make distributors pay more attention to the state of the
software they distribute... and not patch it too much. It
sucks dealing with all the USE=all ricers with Xft patches 
(maybe it's actually gone now) that I will have nothing to 
do with. (Not until I can just flip a simple option in a simple 
non-XML config file not obsoleted by the distro on every second
updated, to get clear crisp fonts (unblurred, bytecode interpreter,
helvetica allowed) on any distro that I might end up having 
to use.

Maybe an interactive tutorial to Ion is possible, using Lua to script
it?  I don't know enough Lua to tell if this is possible.

Emacs, for instance, comes with a tutorial that encourages interaction
with the editor and learning the basic commands.

You just have to be emacs expert to be able to use it, because 
emacs is so clunky. Seriously. Back in 1995 or so, I find joe's
simple and effective ^K H toggleable help screen far more effective
than anything emacs has to offer.

My point was only that interactive tutorials are useful.  At least in
my experience, when I was getting started with Emacs 15 years ago.  I
think Ion would benefit from such a tutorial.

In general terms, it's whatever works to get novice users acquainted
with the concepts and operation of the software without introducing
terms or operations before the users are ready for them.

It's surprisingly difficult to write good tutorials, but I don't think
that means we should drop the idea.  It's completely orthogonal to
features such as Xinerama support.

JE> And you even mentioned Emacs...I'm going to hide now, Tuomo's

Of course it's possible. But the effort needed, that's another
question. 

Actually, you could implement a sticky joe-like help screen relatively
easily with a multi-line statusbar... if someone bothered to write
the multi-line support. And with a little hacking, you could create
some interactive tutoring: make the strings for the keys meters,
and give a suitable attribute to colourise the key you want the user 
to press.

Sure, but someone still needs to write them.

I've been accused of "not being a real hacker/programmer/whatever",
because I refuse to choose between vi and emacs, and use joe instead.
Like I care... sigh.

I used to use jed for small config type edits, and emacs for "real" stuff.

I must be getting old though - I've found myself using kdevelop these days, 
albiet with the emacs keyboard plugin for the kate part.

There was a time when I used jed for the "real" stuff and joe only for
the small edits. But then joe got syntax highlighting, and since jed 
development seems stalled, with many bugs -- especially in the syntax
highlighting and autoindentation department -- I've switched back to
joe entirely.

... and it is not an unimportant factor, that joe has a decent finite
state machine language for the syntax hl, instead of the usual _awful_
regexp hacks that both jed and emacs use. (Yes, regexps are FSMs, but
ones without labelled states/side effects, so you have to combine
them with hacks at the outer level, instead of simply specifying the
syntax in the structure of the FSM.)

of it.
The docs from Toumo and you all have been of great help.

I think this kind of help should actually live in the scratchpad, it's
exactly the right pop-up model.

Also, it should automatically discover the current key bindings for
commands.  So if I rebind "delete split" to key X, I want to see X
there.

TV> Sure, but someone still needs to write them.

OK, let's start with a script.

blank screen = first start (determined by Ion, e.g. by missing ~/.ion3
directory)

Dialog "You seem to be using Ion for the first time.  Would you like a
brief tutorial?"

If yes:

Text "This is a workspace in the Ion window manager.  It can do

1) ...
2) ...
3) ...

Let's start with (1).  Press <KEY> to open a terminal."

Does this seem like the right way to go, a linear tutorial that
introduces simple concepts one by one?

Is anyone interested in contributing to the script or the code to
implement it?

Just make sure that the user first discovers how to pop up the scratchpad  
- and how to pop it away again :) (FWIW, IMHO some minibuffer would be a  
better location)

As already mentioned, this has the problem that the user has to be
able to toggle it on, _and_ also has to toggle it off to do anything.
The statusbar would provide a constantly visible help or instruction
area.

There are no identifiable commands, only arbitrary function calls.
(The closest Ion comes to commands, is the context menu...) However,
by overriding `defbindings`, it is possible to store this information
and the `bdoc` documentation -- which may, however, be too long for 
a simple statusbar help display.

Ion already has first start detection, for the welcome xmessage --
that many seem to ignore.

Perhaps, but as already mentioned, in the scratchpad, it has the
problem of the user having to constantly toggle it.

that's how `mutt' dynamically adjusts it's help pages. I think that is good,
but even better would be augmenting this by parenthesis a la "(changed from
default definition xxx)" so that one could incrementally restore default
bindings easily if need be.

I agree: scratchpad as the sole location is no good for this. but why not make
it available instead of the ion3-manpage with MOD1-F1?  the manpage everyone
will be able to access otherwisei -- be it via F1 (where it is the default
anyway), be it via some xterm.

having the tutorial come up with MOD1-F1 (and an initial xmessage at first
startup that it is there to find) would be a good thing. It could even still be
in `man' format. (or some more flexible troff macro package, such as `ms'. one
then could even use the troff preprocessors such as `tbl', 'eqn', `pic', but
keep the ability to get a reasonable ascii/latin1 approximation of the formatted
document in the terminal).

I recently convinced some colleague to dump GNOME and try out `ion3' (hey!
and just for the record: he at that point tried to compare `ion3' to `wmii' and
immediately dropped the latter due to it's inability to manage his second
monitor). 
what I noticed, then, were two things:

1. the list of default keybindings and available actions is somehow there in the
manpage but people have difficulties at first to understand the terminology
(workspaces, clients, objects, frames etc.) and thus difficulties to understand
what the commands do. conclusion: the tutorial should try to make this easier to
grasp.

2. more important is to tell the users, where to configure what and how: in
other words, each explanation of an action/keybinding should be augmented by the
name of the config-file where I can change the binding. suggesting a strategy how to do
customization in such a way that it survives with minimal damage any update
would be helpful, too (if you simply copies over everything to ~/.ion3 and edits
this heavily you've to start over from scratch the next time, if the
default config-scripts have changed due to update. probably some kind of
`dopath' strategy would be the best thing to suggest?).

It's not doable reliably in the function call based configuration of 
Ion. You'd have to work with a fixed set of command instead, and define
a command for every action that the user might want to do, in addition
to providing the scripting API. It's extra work that I don't want at
this point, the Ion architechture being what it is, although the menu
system does already have some "commands".

on top of the scripting API, go ahead... for ion3plus perhaps. Although,

This may be the last "ds" release if Ion3; if all goes well, the next
release is likely to be an "rc". Some minor improvements will still
be done, and minor requests may be accepted, so be quick.

The most notable changes in this release from the previous one are:

  * Transients and queries in too small frames are "unsqueezed" out
    of them, unless disabled with `ioncore.set{ unsqueeze = false }`.

  * Some changes in default `cfg_ion.lua`: instead of loading
    various other files, just `cfg_default.lua` is loaded instead.

  * `mod_tiling.untile` (available in the context menu) may be used
    to decompose tilings into floating frames. (This is the approximate
    opposite of `mod_tiling.mkbottom` and the "new tiling" context menu
    entry.)

  * Improved context menus.

  * Slightly improved defaults style, using the drawing engine's
    added possibility of partial borders.

  * Various fixes and other improvements, in particular in relation
    to focus code.

The translations (currently cs, de, fi, ru) need to be updated
before Ion goes to "rc" stage. This includes both the .po files,
and the manual pages. Any translations that have not been 
upgraded by then, will be removed.

That said, it may be wise to wait a while to see if there are
any big problems that might end up changing the translations.
I'd suppose it will take at least a month, possibly longer,
before the first "rc" is released.

I do not quite understand (or not at all?): even if one can in principle
use the function call based configuration to do 'arbitrary' things, as it
stands, it seems not illegitimate for a user to read the files in ~/.ion3 as
"static config-files with a strange syntax". my point is simply that at least
for a start it does not harm to approach it in that way and tell the new user:
"if you want to change shortcut x, modify the corresponding line in file y".
so what exactly do you mean by 'not doable reliably'? could it not at least 
be done in a "justifable" way?

I have no real issue with the manpage in its present form, although it is
_very_ terse and probably not that helpful for first time users (afterwards
it serves as a memo for forgotten keyboard shortcuts). I thought the
discussion related to where one should put additional documentation/tutorial
stuff. but of course one could put that in the manpage as well (the 'bash
approach'). I'm not sure whether that's the best way.

Not doable reliably = you have to compare by how the call is written, 
not by what it means.

No, the man page should be a compact reference.

So you and Tuomo noted that the user sees the status bar, but doesn't
see the scratch pad by default.  Thus, the status bar should say
"Press MOD+F1 (MOD is 'Alt' on most keyboards) to see the pop-up help"
and the scratchpad should come up on that keypress, showing the
manual.  That's how I would set things up.

That's very unobtrusive, and as the user matures he will figure out
the scratchpad is not just for help.

I really lack time but I sure am interested ! I'd also like to make
ion's french translation, but at the moment I am stuck in a J2EE
project that bit-rots every day -_-;
I had not even been able to boot Linux since a few months (windows
forced at work/school, too lazy to finish my install at home) and did
not even test the latest ion3.

I did not really understand the fuss of showing a tutorial
(technically speaking) at first ion3 launch since I recall having
something popping up the 1st time (or was it ion2 only ?). I think
only the message which to display in this dialog needs to be thought
about.

Now the concepts I'd like to see in this tutorial are pretty simple,
and the man was quite good enough.


First, let's reassure the user by saying how to get help (MOD1..F1),
how to get out (F12 menu). We want to tell him that we are going to
present defaults keybindings and that he can change them by editing
some files.
It could be nice if we can tell him dynamically which binding to use,
according even his own config (what is MOD1, where are his distrib's
files if no ~/.ion3 is found, and give him the keybindings he has
defined if he already started to play with his config.)

We need to make this intro as short and friendly as possible :
everyone MUST fully read this, and they must find every vital
information. For the rest, if he's hooked he'll read the manpage.


Then, explain how to Create-Destroy-Navigate-Modify frames,
workspaces, scratchpad.
We want to show him many shortcuts, and both keyboard and mouse ways
if possible.

At last, we just show him (or point to files or URLs) advanced stuff
such as the dock, statusbar, create your own menus and position your
windows automatically with winprops.


These were my 2 cents.

I'd rather not interfere with the standard  keybindings here: scratchpad
pops up with mod1+space. 

as I said already, I think the best way to pop up the tutorial would be
mod1+F1 which currently is bound to ion3 manpage (as is F1<RET>, which suffices
for getting to the manpage). I really don't see a point in popping up the help
in the scratchpad frame: it's by default and for good reason a rather small frame in
the middle of the screen. that's exactly what one wants here most of the time: a
small window where one can issue `make' or whatever). if you display a longer
document here, one _always_ would need to maximize the scratchpad first (if one
knows how to do it...). I find the current approach taken with the manpages via F1 much
more sensible: use whichever frame you happen to be in. same should
happen with the tutorial  when issuing mod1+F1.
usually this will than display in a large frame allowing to read the document in a sensible
way.

question: what are the ideas for achieving formatting? should this be written as a troff
manpage like the real manpage (might be OK)? or what else? I'd definitely
advocate to use something which allows to get sensible formatted output to the
terminal (just as `man'). if people are comfortable with it, I'd propose 'troff/ms'
wich would allow better control over formatting. (a bit of advertising for this
dinosaur: it's always there, just as `troff/man',  
it's definitely not more complicated than the `troff/man' macros and
it would allow easy integration of nicely formatted tables via the `tbl'
preprocessor' even for terminal output -- might be helpful for the keybinding
lists... and maybe(...) I could at least take over formatting if you feel
uncomfortable with it).

in eithcer case `man' and `ms' would allow to format into pdf, html, too. yes. TeX
would be working too (but not for sensible terminal output), but talking of
bloatware... and please, please: not texinfo... I think the best thing is to have
(as far as possible) nicely formatted output in a terminal which is piped
through `less' for navigation/searching.

and finally: I would'nt like to  have a permanent 'help' entry in the statusbar. 
I feel it should go in the F12 menu (together with `about', 'help'. here I would
argue to occupy the `help' entry with the new stuff and change the current
'help' to 'manpages' or 'man' because that's what it is). the user must somehow
have learned initially of the F12 menu otherwise he/she won't get out of ion3 at
all. another hint to the tutorial should go in the manpage (SEE ALSO), 
which one can expect that every users has had a look at .

What is meant here, that one cannot dynamically adapt the manpages to the
current shortcuts bound to specific actions. Since one binds a keyboard
shortcut to an arbitrary piece of lua code, there could be a lot of different
ways to write "close the current frame", so ion can't really tell which key(s)
are bound to "close the current frame".

One could of course string-compare the bound lua code to the default lua code,
which will work when the user has only changed keybindings, not the code that
it is supposed to run. Yet, this is rather ugly and unreliable (defaults might
change, for example).

Pointing a user to which file the default key binding for an action is, is
possible of course (but that will falter as soon as bindings are moved by the
user).

That's not entirely true: there's the `bdoc` documentation, from which the
man pages _are_ generated. You could just override in a script the default
implementation of defbindings that Ion provides, and store this information
is the bindings are defined. Of course, the user neds to keep the descriptions
up-to-date with their changes for this to work.

If it is written in troff/*, then definitely as an additional
'ion3tutorial' man page. 

One option might be to use markdown, which generates HTML. That's
what the Ion README, the site, etc. are written in these days. You
can obviously turn that into a text file with e.g. lynx -dump, and
maybe into PDF too in some automated way. The sucky thing is the
extra dependencies, if it's included in the Ion distribution. (I do
not like ReST etc.; markdown seems to be the only one of these ASCII
markup language with at least a bit of moderation on the amount of
special syntax.) But maybe having it as a man page would be better...

But, no, Mod1+F1 should not be changed from displaying the reference
man page. F12 -> 'tutorial' should suffice -- and displaying this
tutorial and how to get to it in the welcome message.

However, I think that a simple help screen (in the statusbar) should
be much more effective than a zillion words that few bother to read.
Consider e.g. the following screen toggleable in joe with ^KH (missing
formatting in this message). It has all the basic bindings quickly 
visible, so you can just try them to find out what works.

   Help Screen    turn off with ^KH    more help with ESC . (^[.)              
 CURSOR           GO TO            BLOCK      DELETE   MISC         EXIT

I'd say that would be a reasonable solution, also using troff/ms would
not complicate things (it's all the same as with troff/man - just another
macro package better suited for larger documents (section handling etc.)
the `-man'-macros are posing at tighter frame so to speak: it's obviously the
right thing for usual manpages and it's rather obviously not the right thing for
lengthy stuff such as the `bash' manpage. I really believe that `-ms' would be
better suited  for a tutorial/handbook. display would proceed exactly the same:
instead of calling `nroff -man some_file' you'd do `nroff -ms some_file'. so
it's really a question whether the ms-macros are too complicated to use (they
are'nt, maybe easier than '-man').

yes. or an ms-document: e.g., I believe the system V UNIX manuals are written with 
it (or am I wrong?).

No particular reason... but I don't think a tutorial should have
a special reserved key, unlike a reference. Now, if there was a 
statusbar reference or so, then Mod1+F1 would be the suitable key
for that.

It'd be nice if people would report any significant omissions
and bugs in the reference documentation [1]. It's time to bring
it up to date now. No, tutorial material does not belong there.
The document is meant to be a scripting/configuration reference.

the original `man' did directly execute `troff -man' I believe. the variant coming 
with OSX/FreeBSD gives the following for

`man -d ion3':

(cd /opt/local/share/man && /usr/bin/gunzip -c '/opt/local/share/man/man1/ion3.1.gz' | /usr/bin/tbl | /usr/bin/groff -Wall -mtty-char -Tascii -mandoc -c | less -fR)


i.e. it actually pipes the manpage source first through `tbl' and than through

/usr/bin/groff -Wall -mtty-char -Tascii -mandoc -c.

it boils down to selecting terminal output with -Tascii
and selecting the macropackage with -mandoc (which in turn branches
to `mdoc' or `man' macros whichever appropriate for the manpage source file).
another macro-package (tty-char) defines some characters.

if writing the tutorial (which actually need not be the complete story. why not
leave room for getting a 'real' manual a la `mutt'?) with `-ms' one would not
call

man tutorial.txt

but rather essentially replace `-mandoc' by `-ms' in the `groff' call used
by `man':

groff -Tascii -mtty-char -ms tutorial.txt

or actually probably:

groff -Tlatin1 -mtty-char -ms tutorial.txt.

that would be the whole difference. if tables are included one would do
the same thing as can be seen with the `man' pipe:

groff -t -Tlatin1 -mtty-char -ms tutorial.txt

(piping through `tbl' can be initiated by the `-t' flag of groff, too).

and finally pipe it through less -fR, of course.

so, if the tutorial is called via some keybinding or menu it does'nt matter.
if the user wants to view it from the command line it's of course inferior to
`man' since you would have to locate it in the `share' directory or whatever
and know how to view it (but that could be explained in a comment block at the
beginning of the file of course). but on the positive side: `ms'  is to `troff'
what  `latex' is to `tex', i.e. a comprehensive macro package allowing much
better control than the `-man' macros.

in case someone is interested (and it is not stripped from the mail) I attach a
small `ms'-tutorial which probably  is written with `ms' itself so you get an
impresssion (autonumbered sections, table of content, etc.) the ion3 manual
might look similar in the end.

as I said, I rather think of it as the first chapter of the 'ultimate guide to
ion3' :-). so I don't really care whether it is reached via mod1+f1 or via
f12-menu (but still think one does not  need the ion3 manpage twice (mod1+f1 and
f1<cr>) in the keybindings.

I definitely would not like a permanently visible entry in the statusbar (it's
like all the "HELP" entries in main menues of applications: wasting valuable
space).

So, no, you can't make an 'ion3tutorial' man page if you use the 'ms' 
package, which pretty much takes away the whole point of using the
ancient *roff.

would you tolerate, for once, "bug-reports" ("page 4, paragraph 5 should
read...") instead of using `darcs' (maybe I have time to look through the
reference, but no time for understanding the workings of `darcs' first...)?

Learning the necessary to use darcs to submit patches is a matter of
minutes indeed. You need "darcs get" to get a copy, "darcs record -a"
to commit your changes, and "darcs send" to send it to Tuomo.

Of course I'd prefer patches, but I didn't ask for them: I asked for
bug reports. If such page numbering is used, one should remember to
ues the released version then (and preferrably the dvi/ps/pdf/whatever
on the Web page or the tarball, to make sure that the numbering is
the same).

I don't agree with the conclusion (duck and cover...):

a) `groff' is not ancient at all and still actively maintained (`groff' is
actually more recent than TeX). If you mean the whole concept: old, yes but
quite capable of achieving almost the same ps/pdf quality as with TeX. even the
really ancient original `troff' which hangs around on commercial Unixes still would
work OK for most things. it's _much_ smaller too (one to two orders of
magnitude for the size of the distribution, probably...) and faster.
the assessment that groff is "the thing which formats manpages" is a rather
small fraction of the truth.

b) `groff' is simply part of any Linux and xxxBSD distro (without it `man'
would'nt work). that's a big difference relative to, say, TeX or some other
markup stuff. one can rely on it being present.

c) my main point right from the start was, that `groff' is probably the only
formatter around which is capable of providing nicely formatted output in the
terminal (see `man') including (bold/underlining margin adjustment etc.) in
addition to allowing generation of a professional quality pdf version, say.
my preference for browsing "finite size" manuals is `less', just like what
I do with the manpages. I don't need no heavy intra-document 
crosslinking (although it were possible with groff -Thtml). the terminal output
of `groff' is _much_ more readable than some text dump.

d) the difference between using `man' and using `groff -ms' is marginal:
`man' is only providing the automatic lookup along MANPATH and 
the construction of the `groff' call. if the tutorial were written with `ms'
instead (which would scale much better to extending the thing in the future)
one would have to bind the corresponding key to the correct groff call instead
-- so what?  requiring to reach a tutorial via `man' in the shell manually --
which I said is the only thing really sacrificed when switching to `-ms' -- I
feel is not necessary.

e) I think the decision between `groff -man' and `groff -ms' should be more
dependent of whether the people contributing would go to the trouble of
learning new macros (supposing they are fluent with `-man', which might not
really be the case: then `-ms' probably is actually easier) and whether one
wants to get more control over formatting layout in a way  which would allow
to create a real manual, not only a manpage. I think it would'nt harm if one
would not loose this option without better reasons than that the tutorial
would simply not pop up via `man tutorial'.

For the tutorial, I was thinking of something a lot more interactive,
not just a text document.  I'd like to prompt the user to press keys,
navigate with the mouse, etc.

The command set and syntax are from the 1950s or something, when you 
had  to to write it all on a punchcard. You can't make heads or tails of
it just by looking at the file; you have to look at the documentation.
That doesn't lend to random contributors improving the documentation.
LaTeX, on the other hand, has commands that are understandable when
you look at the document, even if you didn't know how to write a LaTeX
document from scratch. Too bad LaTeX documents are hardly understandable
by other programs, them being programs themselves.

I still think that using such arcane formats as *roff is pointless, 
unless you're writing a man page.

what file? the markupped text? I don't think that `ms' markup is harder (or 
easier) to understand than latex markup. for the macro definitions themselves:
yeah, that's sort of crazy (but probably the low level TeX stuff does not look
better). looking at the documentation as a prerequisite of generating a
sensible document: would you say that is different from latex???

> That doesn't lend to random contributors improving the documentation.
tell me: where is the difference between `-ms' and `-man' markup in terms
of your points (random contributors don't understand it, 'old', etc)?

same thing with groff (being a program), of course.
so: you know how to use latex, I know how to use groff. that seems the basic
difference.
concerning "understanding" the latex source: I will give you that latex markup
is much more verbose (which I don't like: I have to type it or make lots of 
vi shortcuts or what else) and therefore one could easier guess that

\begin{paragraph}

is just that, than that

.LP

(for left adjusted paragraph) does just the same in `groff -ms'. but the 10 odd
pages I sent around concering use of `ms' seem to compare rather favourably to
the length of the average latex guide...

I still think you are wrong but will leave it at that. but hey, guys, why not,
at least put this in a file `tutorial.txt`:

.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------

F1;access manpages
F2;xterm

.NH
customizing your statusbar
.LP
can be tough.
.NH 2
statusbar: the basic layout

.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
things to memorize to 'read' the above: 

`.\"' -- is the admittedly strange start_of_comment .
`.TL' -- title
`.AU' -- author
`.AI' -- author's institution
`.NH' -- starts new numbered section header (trailing number is section level) 
`.LP' -- starts new leftjustified paragraph, 
`.TS/.TE' --  brackets tables ('table start', 'table end') 

now issue :

1. `groff -t -ms tutorial.txt > tutorial.ps; gv tutorial.ps'
2. `groff -t -ms -TX100 tutorial.txt'
3. `nroff -t -ms tutorial.txt'

and look (and compare with what you need to achieve approx. the same with `-man' or
`latex' (where latex is not an option if one wants to maintain formatting into
the terminal)).

my vote:
best solution: use `ms'
second best solution: use `man'

It is very much harder: just look at the example you posted. Do you consider
that readable? Aside from the command names being totally unintelligible
pairs of characters, even the flow breaks all the time with the commands
starting a new line.

A sensible LaTeX document can be edited to a large extend without
knowing any LaTeX, by aping what is there already, as it is quite
intelligible. Not so with *roff.

It's not that verbose: You don't write the longer commands that often,
paragraph separation is an empty line, etc. You also don't have to
break the flow all the time unlike with *roff. (Yeah, there's also 
some inline syntax at least in -man, but it's quite awful HT/XML-like 
begin/end tag stuff.)

Anyway, the original idea indeed was that of an _interactive_ tutorial.

that starts to develop in a "I'll have the last word" exchange (well I try to :-)):

if you markup the posted example with latex, 
the content vs. markup ratio would not be better, but worse. if you really
start to write a paragraph, that will be simple continous and perfectly readable
text in the source file, be it in groff, be it in latex. arguing groff vs.
latex is like battling whether emacs or vi is better (I know, you'd say they
suck both and one should use joe). everything I've heard against 'groff -ms' in
this exchange is a matter-of taste decision against it using arguments which
would be equally suited to propose dumping manpages written in -man.

> pairs of characters, even the flow breaks all the time with the commands
> starting a new line.

come on: "unintelligible pairs of characters" in contrast to ion3 keyboard
shortcuts which lend themselves immediately to memorizing???  I'd estimate that
I continously use about 10-20 ion3 keybindings and probably fewer `-ms' names.
I still manage to handle that...

correct for you because you know latex. the other way round for me because I
know groff. what kind of criterion is that?  and this trails off: latex would
not be an option here, I'd say, if we want to maintain formattting into the
terminal. that tex/latex altogether is the more powerful formatter than groff:
yeah, could be, but that's irrelevant in the present context (and usually becomes
only notable with the better support of table-of-content, auto-generated
indexes, auto-generated dynamic running headers/footers and such). I would
say the central question presently is: how can I get both, optimal terminal
output _and_ professional publication quality pdf (plus html, maybe).

you could do that in groff the same way.

I'd rather get a mutt-like _comprehensive_ user manual which contrary to the
above idea would stay useful even for the permanent ion3-user. the kind of
really basic interactive tutorial, which seems to be more the intent as I now
see, probably will be used (and be useful) only at the very first day of using ion3.
that's a waste of effort in my view.

so, please stay at least  with 'man/ groff -man' (but why that in contrast
to `groff -ms' is tolerable remains obscure to me), don't use non-standard third
party stuff which would create additional dependencies.

if you still answer this, the last word in this matter is yours. promise. :-)

*roff-man is antiquated, and should be replaced. Too bad TeXinfo sucks 
bad, and if such a system was designed by the kids today, it would be
XML shite. I rather stick to *roff-man.

I also prefer clear intelligible commands to a zillion key bindings.
I prefer writing, say, \alpha in LaTeX, than Control+Shift+Meta+Whatever+a,
or something, is some formula editor might provide as a "shortcut" 
(the term implies flawed design) alternative to mousing. The LaTeX
command is very intelligible; that key sequence isn't.

I could understand much of LaTeX source without knowing any LaTeX. 
Not so with *roff (or plain-TeX, for the matter... any many Wiki
markups are quite awful too).

And I prefer uninterrupted text that looks like a document with some

Because it provides something that other formats do not provide: 
compatibility with the man system. I'm sure there's something that
can provide `catman` output for less etc. from HTML, and thus from
various other source formats.

At risk of starting a flamewar, I personally dislike all the ctrl-k shortcuts, 
so I reconfigured them.  I don't want to have to hit three keys at different 
ends of the keyboard to do a simple action!  If you're doing it repeatedly, 
it can get very clumsy.

Try hitting Control+x and then some other key at the same end of the
keyboard -- impossible, unless your hands are made of rubber.

I've got this lot.  I also disabled F3/F5/F6, because many apps use F3 
for "find next", F5 for "reload", and F6 for "highlight location bar" (in web 
browsers).

    kpress(MOD1.."XF86AudioNext", "ioncore.exec_on(_, 'mpc seek +00:00:10')"),
    kpress(MOD1.."XF86AudioPrev", "ioncore.exec_on(_, 'mpc seek -00:00:10')"),
    kpress("XF86Standby", "ioncore.exec_on(_, 'xlock')"),
    kpress(MOD1.."T", "WRegion.set_tagged(_sub, 'toggle')", "_sub:non-nil"),
    kpress(MOD1.."A", "WFrame.attach_tagged(_)"),
        ^^^  got rid of the alt-k
    kpress(MOD1.."I", "WFrame.switch_next(_)"),
    kpress(MOD1.."U", "WFrame.switch_prev(_)"),
        ^^^ easy to switch around with the right hand.

it's not so much whether control-x is better/worse than mod1-K. it's using two
keys here, which is annoying. of course if the keyboard is exhausted, 
that's the way to go for the remaining actions. but right now quite a few 

mod1+some_key

combinations are not used at all by default. 
I, too, remapped all the frequently occuring things to such combinations, e.g.

mod1+Q instead of mod1+K-P
mod1+W instead of mod1+K-N

which probably is the most frequently needed action in the whole of ion3, at
least with non-cinemascope monitors (maybe together with mod1+TAB, so having these
three near each other essentially takes care of 95% of the navigation).

so while I guess that the mod1+K scheme came about due to your use of `joe',
I believe that the minimum number of keyhits should be aimed at, i.e. first
exhaust the two-key kombinations for the frequent actions than use three  keys
for the more arcane ones.

I agree, I've done the same ;) But there's no point in eradicating C-K
in the default bindings, that only pushed me to make my own scheme
(base on Win+arrows most of the time).

I've seen many people feeling the need to reconfigure their bindings
to fit their habits or their language, they wouldn't have done this
effort if at some point they did not find something really irritating.

But overall, the defaults are not so 'impossible' anyway.

> for "find next", F5 for "reload", and F6 for "highlight location bar"

You mean C-R and C-L (and its friend C-K) ? In Firefox / IE at least ;)


I also agree with Joerg, but having a keyboard full of MOD+single_key
combos would probably be really strange. There is a high probability
of a newbie being scared by a window split when mistakenly hitting
alt-S or Win-S instead of his often-used C-S.

I do not aim at being interface nazi but ion is about taking back
control, so why not incitate users to do so ? Anyone here added some
bindings or looked in the documentation for a rarely-used function he
needed, that's perfect !

You know your config, you are not surprised and you are efficient (if
not, you change again). The MS-Windows alt-shift combination for
changing keyboard input (FR-US) is often mistakenly typed and a
non-computer-literate person could really freak out (imagine what it
could have been if you installed dvorak...)


In short : force users to change their bindings ! They'll be happy ever after :)
ion3 users are not the casual user anyway, they won't be (so) scared.


Just my 2 cents.

I was commenting on the idea of having a help screen, not any particular 
choice of bindings.  It would be great if the help screen could take 
into account rebinding.

Yeah I already said that, sorry for going into the (announced) flamebait ;)

I still don"t know if that's technically and easily feasible, but
that's what some games do (Prince of Persia 3/4) and for some friends
that like dvorak, it really was welcome when it bound four keys in the
right place (e, o and...) instead of just looking for the famous WASD
(which must be pretty much scattered everywhere).
Just looking for those four keys are a pain on an azerty (fr) keyboard
when you can't change the config can be quite disturbing.

Tuomo suggested one way of doing this (using bdoc), another might be to use a
menu structure to represent commonly used commands and set up a
helper-function that would call a particular menu entry, which would then be
bound rather than the lua code itself.  The bdoc method is likely to be more
informative, but the menu method is probably more likely to survive
unsophisticated changes to keybindings.  Basically you'd be setting up a
kluge of a "command" type on top of the lua function calls.

",a;h" if you're wondering....

As a dvorak user I tend to change my keybindings extensively.  You can get
used to anything, of course -- I still use hjkl, even thought the keys I
press would be "jcvp" on a qwerty keyboard.  But for a lot of less frequently
used commands I use custom menus bound to keys via mod_query.  And I use
app.lua instead of virtually all of the navigational keybindings.

Actually, a better solution would probably be to simply create a table
consisting of command names and strings of lua code implementing them.  The
helper function would simply evaluate to the lua string, which would get
bound.  No real need to get it messed up with the menu structures.  If
desired there could be a lookup table of documentation for the commands as
well.

The slightly tricky bit would be to account for the different sorts of
options passed in the binding (_, _sub, etc.).  Simplest would be to make
different ways of calling the lua function different commands, where
necessary.

You'd end up devising something like the context menu definitions
and generation code. You need to define commands for the contexts
they are available in, and that's what the context menus do.
The Mod1+M query_menu is a sort of command query already.

It's not a lot of work to add all the usual commands in the
context and other menus, and some extra options to prune out
the entries from the menus that would not normally be needed
in them. However, maintaining separate documentation is extra
work.

Presuming you're on a platform and have privileges for running darcs.
(Compiling darcs, not to mention ghc, without ghc is not an easy feat either.)

But yes, learning enough should be pretty simple.
Perhaps the documentation should have a "darcs for dummies" (well,
accepted practices) paragraph :)

Subject: (not quite) full-sreen
Message-ID: <20070322143744.GA3068@marco.fz-rossendorf.de>

thankfully, the maintainer of the ion3 package on `macports' was able to upgrade
it from 3ds-20060524 (which I used happily up to now) to 3ds-20070203, so I
upgraded and adjusted to the changes in the config files etc.

I know of the persistent problems with filling frames completely with xterms and
such and that supposedly is a xterm problem, not ion's. I  noted that with the
old variant and with the new one, too.

but what I noted now is, that when hitting mod1+<CR> the fullscreen window does,
too, no longer extent all the way  to the screen edges, but rather leaves a
substantial rim where the X11 root screen is visible (I'd estimate 5-10 pixels?).
that definitely was different with the old version which indeed occupied
_everything_ in full screen mode.

is the current behaviour intentionally?
or is it a problem of the mac/osx/ x11 server?

regards,
joerg

Hello.


I have one question about Ion3 : is there a simple way to invert the
actions of mouse buttons 'Button1' and 'Button2' ? I could not find a
reference to this in the documentation ...

Or would it be simpler for me to automatically replace all entries
'Buttonx' in the configuration files ?

Many thanks for writing a USABLE window manager.

Kind regards.

I'm just about to upload a Debian package of this.  Some things I noted
while preparing it:

- Context menus for frames now affect the current object.  Previously
  (certainly in 20061223; I'm not sure about 20070203) they would
  affect the tab that the context menu was opened on.  This change
  doesn't seem to have been documented, but I've noted it in
  NEWS.Debian.  Was it an intentional change?

- Size request changes by docked applications (I use "docker") seem to
  be ignored.  I narrowed this down to the patch 'Full screen mode fixes
  and improvements'.  I don't understand quite what this is doing, so
  for now I've simply reverted it in the Debian package.

- Minor nit: rootwin_init() does:
    LINK_ITEM(*(WRegion**)&ioncore_g.rootwins, (WRegion*)rootwin, p_next, p_prev);
  and similarly rootwin_deinit() does:
    UNLINK_ITEM(*(WRegion**)&ioncore_g.rootwins, (WRegion*)rw, p_next, p_prev);
  I think these casts violate the aliasing rules, but I'm not certain.

Ben.

No. The config changed to pass _chld instead of _sub, but the pointer
event code doesn't do anything sane with it. But, _chld is needed
to get the context of the active client window or so. (_sub is 
a WGroupCW on a client window tab, whereas _chld should be a 
WClientWin... it's just not anything corresponding to the tab...)

PS. I really don't like the _chld/_sub distinction, that was added
when client windows were changed to be contained in their own 
groups (workspaces) etc. It might be possible to remove _sub with
WRegion.groupleader_of(), as _sub is mainly needed to operate on 
a group within an mplex but it would make the config a little bit
more complicated.

There's a longstanding bug report about the meaning of "stretchable
space" which is mentioned briefly in the default configuration but not
in the reference: <http://bugs.debian.org/319870>.

I use the following to switch to a left handed configuration (with an
optical Microsoft wheel mouse)

 xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1 4 5"

and the following when I want to switch back to right handed configuration:

 xmodmap -e "pointer = default"


Hope this helps.
