Well, ion is mostly stable and complete, but it does have some problems with certain software (java software particularly) and, if I've understood correctly, it's desirable to get better multihead support. It would be fun to see a graphic engine with support for icons/more control over individual tab colors too.

How many are familiar at all with the source? I've poked around quite a bit, and uses a slightly modified ion3-plus daily. I don't have much time in the nearest future however.
