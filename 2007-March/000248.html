<PRE>Hello everybody.  I've agreed to adopt the Debian packages of ion3, but
have not yet made any changes to them.

I'm quite happy to include a clear notice that bugs and queries should
be reported to me as the maintainer rather than you.  However, this is
what users should do for any package, and there's not much I can do
about (l)users that don't know about reportbug or how to find the
maintainer's email address.  They probably won't read the Debian
documentation either.

ion3 has been removed from the testing suite and will not be included in
the etch release.

&gt;<i>    The reasons are simple: a) if your distro is supposedly &quot;stable&quot;, it

</I>
I agree, actually; I think Debian has very variable levels of support
for released packages and this is not made clear to users.  Since you
say ion3 is not in a state to be supported for the lifetime of a Debian
release, I must accept that.  Therefore I will try to keep it up-to-date
in unstable and backports.

No-one accuses Debian of that, surely? ;-)

Ben.
