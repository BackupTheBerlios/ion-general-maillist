<PRE>&gt;<i> Requested features:
</I>Tuomo said he wouldn't develop new features and focuses on the last
stable ion version.

&gt;<i> Policy settings for the new window creation.
</I>This is done using winprops in cfg_kludges.lua.
I think the main distribution includes some kludges samples.

&gt;<i> Auto size adjust for the fixed size applications at start.
</I>
Tuomo thinks this is brain damaged. If he were even to develop that,
what should happen when many apps will try to set their own fixed size
? One cannot decide.
Then, what will happen to your desktop when even a single fixed size
app will come and mess everything up ?

My policy about fixed size apps is preparing the layout for them then
using winprops to make them stick into their allowed space.

&gt;<i> Switching the application to full screen mode, and back
</I>This already exists, grep fullscreen in your cfg_bindings.lua.

&gt;<i> Mouse aided tile resize.
</I>This already exists.

&gt;<i> GUI based configuration tool for the keybindings.
</I>&gt;<i> Support for alternate keybindings.
</I>
I don't think there are many users out there still using the default
keybindings.
This encourages people to look at cfg_bindings.lua and make their own,
which is IMHO an excellent policy.

&gt;<i> Icon based, floating style application launcher.
</I>
There might be some apps doing that but that doesn't sound like ion's
business to me.

Sorry if my advice seems outdated, I've been Windows-imprisoned for a long time.
