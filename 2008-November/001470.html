<PRE>&gt;<i> Yep, you can do incredible things in 10 lines. But to think how to write
</I>&gt;<i> those few lines takes ten times as long as the writing the corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> 1000 lines of C.
</I>
Well, c'est la vie :)

And see--kidding ... you certainly are not a *belalang*--the signature ;)

To go back to the eccentric scuba-diving (see previous emails) off-topic: we
Swiss from Lugano were, with the Bolognesi from Italy, among the (no kidding)
&quot;strongest [sic] in Europe&quot; ... except when there were the Russians (former
Soviet Union) around. In that case it was a &quot;_pain_&quot; truly. Those Russians
were Martians, also a galaxy apart technologically speaking: not much dineros
in the wallet, but the most advanced [read: best designed] flippers (to be
copied every time); the first to use sonars for navigation (buoy searching),
etc. A bit like with ice hockey, which maybe (Finland) you know better than
scuba diving.

Alternatively; my (retired) analysis professor, the most gifted and
g-e-n-i-a-l professor I have seen ever, a Polya's personal friend, and the
brother of a know Swiss philosopher, has told us--students--once that after
graduating (mathematics) he has tried to continue studying mathematics (his
domain of interest was differential equations applied to membranes, or
something like that) in France, at the time perhaps #1 in Europe for best
schools. He had to return to Switzerland though because the tempo and the
progress demanded was mad, crazy in his words, and could not keep the pace.

&gt;<i> That approach doesn't scale to big projects
</I>
Well, I have not proposed to rewrite Linux or PostgreSQL in Haskell yet ...
