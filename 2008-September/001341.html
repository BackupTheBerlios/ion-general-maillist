A bit off-topic, but not that much off--provided we apply some [algebraic]
substitutions ... keep reading: from globalresearch.ca's &quot;Politics and
Religion in America: Imagine There's No Heaven^1,&quot; which I am reading right
now by the way, and perhaps dramatizing [given the context] a bit

    ...
    Belief in theism, on the other hand, can have serious consequences. In
    fact, theism is unavoidably a simplistic and utopian vision. It may not
    result in adoption of any other simplistic visions, and it may not result
    in the use of force, but it does put one's mind in the habit of accepting
    nonsensical wishful thinking. Theism includes a &quot;belief&quot; that something
    called a god controls the world, and usually includes a &quot;belief&quot; that
    death is not real. Some of the most admirable people in the history of
    the world and living today have held these beliefs, and some of them have
    not. But these are beliefs that, if they have any impact at all, tend as
    a rule to encourage acceptance of the status quo, to discourage personal
    responsibility, and to put one in the habit of believing transparent
    falsehoods. That many people overcome these influences, with various
    degrees of success, does not make them less real.
    ...

... seen the last sentence?
