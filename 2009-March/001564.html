 Hi, I tried to compile and run ion3 without installing it and I took apparently the painful way.
 I ended up copying most .lua and configuration files to ~/.ion3/lib just because ion3 was looking for them there and otherwise couldn't find them. (Why can't it try also in the current directory?).

 Then I found that ion started with a &#8222;segmentation fault&#8220; error (more info below). Much later I discovered the cause: there was a file I couldn't copy to ~/.ion3/lib because it wasn't in ion's source. It is look.lua and is created in the etc/Makefile as a symlink to look_newviolet.lua.

 My request is: instead of creating a link to it at install time, can ion really have a look.lua file which refers (like in #include) look_newviolet.lua? In this way the file doesn't need a special installation step; it is just copied like the others.
 If not, maybe the defaulting to look_newviolet.lua can be included in the C code, so that if it doesn't find look.lua at least it doesn't crash with a segmentation fault.
 I would even find better if ion stopped with an useful error message when it can't find look.lua.
