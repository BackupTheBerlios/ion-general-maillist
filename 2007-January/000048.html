What we're doing (well, what I'm doing, most of the time) is no
different to having something printed out for reference while I'm
working.

In some cases the reference is some sane reflowable format, so there'd
be no difficulty in fitting everything on one (normal-sized) screen.
But often, it's PDF, which (I find, anyway) doesn't fit readably on a
1280x1024 screen concurrently with an editor.  Same seems true of
quite a bit of web-based documentation.

So I use two monitors.  Alternatives would be a bigger screen, and
that would work fine, I expect.  Obviously printing things out, though
it's handy to have searchable things, and I routinely refer to quite a
lot of material.  Or switching between workspaces, of course.  It's
just that much more convenient just to have another monitor.
