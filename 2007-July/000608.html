<PRE>&gt;<i> XFS aka. eXtremely Futile System
</I>
So goes life: I never have had a problem with xfs--you
have. The notebook is one and half months old. The desktop
I have too is much older. And it uses xfs as well ... xfs
since I have migrated from reiser4, another very, very
good fs. (I have migrated because of Hans Reiser tragedy
with his wife, you might know about what I am talking;
reiser4 demanded a patch at every kernel release, and the
patches did start to lag behind too much.)

Figure, I have started with reiser3 even with 2.2.x, and
have moved to reiser4 with the first 2.6.x. Brilliant,
superb software!, I virtually never have had problems with
both reiser3 and 4. (Ditto with xfs.)

And believe me, I have unwillingly tested *in vivo*
those fs well. The desktop runs 24/7 ... power outages
permitting [I don't use any UPS longer]. That makes ...?!
one-two power outages a day on the average; with days
having more than ten power outages. (Sumatra belongs also
to the regions in the world where lightnings hit the
most.)

Example: power outage; after two minutes, power is back;
system starts to reboot; after 40 seconds [15 waiting
in LILO] power dies again; after one minute power is
back again; system begins rebooting; 50 seconds later,
peng--next power outage; blackout for one hour; power is
back; all goes well for the next six hours; peng, next
power outage. Etc.

Disagree: xfs, is even more reliable than reiser4 in my
experience. (But I have loved reiser4 very much.)

In a sense you remember me ... have you read The Three
Spinners from the Brother Grimm's Fairy Tales? Voila',
those three strange women, &quot;the first of whom had a broad
flat foot, the second such a great underlip that it hung
down over her chin, and the third had a broad thumb.&quot; (And
read the fairy tale to discover why if you don't know
yet.)

You are good. But if you are living ahead others really,
or think so, then learn to accept that: you are walking in
a not much crowded area by definition.

Don't let complaining--just because living in a rarefied
air is hard--become your *professional*, chronic
deformation. There exist many, many other people who have
even more right than you--though for other reasons--to
complain. (But they don't or can't.)

Bah, *selamat tidur* (here it's nearly 03h), and cheers,


/Roy
