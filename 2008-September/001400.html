<PRE>Some reminders why I will have nothing to do with shit-o-rama:

The downfall of X:

        <A HREF="http://iki.fi/tuomov/b/archives/2008/07/13/T18_03_06/">http://iki.fi/tuomov/b/archives/2008/07/13/T18_03_06/</A>

IRC log from today:

19:45 &lt;xxx&gt; arf..
19:45 &lt;xxx&gt; is there a way to force ion to make all windows visible?
19:45 &lt;xxx&gt; it keeps eating my KDE transients
19:45 &lt;xxx&gt; as in, they show up for the split second, then vanish
19:46 &lt;xxx&gt; leaving me with a frozen app
19:46 &lt;xxx&gt; which is especially awesome when it is the krita save-dialog that 
            i'd *really* like to see so i can save my last 30 minutes of work

...

20:18 &lt;xxx&gt; no, it's on a floating workspace

...

20:20 &lt;tuomov&gt; umm...
20:20 &lt;tuomov&gt; you don't use the shit-o-rama module, do you?
20:20 &lt;xxx&gt; yes OFCOURSE i'm using shit-o-rama BECAUSE there is no alternative 
            when you use two screens.
20:21 &lt;tuomov&gt; good bye
20:21 &lt;tuomov&gt; it absolutely 100% fucking certainly won't work
20:21 &lt;tuomov&gt; because krita will then have a messed up idea of geometries
20:21 &lt;tuomov&gt; xinerama is fucked
20:21 &lt;tuomov&gt; it does not provide a multihead model
20:22 &lt;tuomov&gt; so one has to provide one with virtual root windows, i.e. extra 
               windows between the actual frames and the root window
20:22 &lt;tuomov&gt; and apps don't understand that
20:22 &lt;tuomov&gt; and calculate their geometries in a fucked up manner
20:22 &lt;xxx&gt; i think i'll start trying to get used to wmii today. ion served me 
            okay the last 2 years but those annoyances stack up. it's just 
            flakey, stuff stops working randomly or works only
            intermittently 
            in first place. 
20:22 &lt;tuomov&gt; raz: it's a fucking xinerama problem, not ion
20:23 &lt;tuomov&gt; I don't have fucking anything to do with shit-o-rama
20:23 &lt;xxx&gt; tuomov, it's ions job to fucking work around it
20:23 &lt;tuomov&gt; why are you complaining here, when you're using shit-o-rama?
20:23 &lt;xxx&gt; tuomov, also it *worked before* but some recent kde update broke it
20:23 &lt;tuomov&gt; it's not my fucking code, you idiot fuckwit
20:23 &lt;xxx&gt; tuomov, it's your fucking wm
20:23 &lt;tuomov&gt; I don't want to have anything to do with shit-o-rama
20:23 &lt;tuomov&gt; it's not my fucking mod_shitorama
20:23 &lt;tuomov&gt; I don't want to have anything to do with that shit
20:23 &lt;tuomov&gt; it won't work
20:24 &lt;tuomov&gt; guess why I don't want to have anything to do with it? because 
               it won't work
20:24 &lt;tuomov&gt; it can't work
20:24 &lt;tuomov&gt; it's fucke dup
20:24 &lt;tuomov&gt; use ion without mod_shitorama, and things might work
20:24 &lt;tuomov&gt; you don't need it, if your screens merge well, and you're 
               content with the same workspaces spanning over both screens
20:25 &lt;tuomov&gt; it's only needed to emulate proper separate screens, but it 
               won't work
20:25 &lt;xxx&gt; i'm not content because my right screen is SMALLER.
20:25 &lt;tuomov&gt; then make them properly separate, don't use shit-o-rama
20:25 &lt;xxx&gt; and i somewhat like to see the bottom part of my windows.
20:25 &lt;tuomov&gt; use plain old x multihead
20:25 &lt;xxx&gt; then i can't move windows between workspaces.
20:25 &lt;xxx&gt; so i could just as well use two separate computers. not quite my 
            use-case.
20:25 &lt;tuomov&gt; that's what you have to choose between
20:26 &lt;tuomov&gt; or better yet: donate the second screen to some poor kid in 
               africa
...

20:27 &lt;tuomov&gt; maybe someone can write a shitorama setup that doesn't use 
               virtual roots
20:27 &lt;tuomov&gt; by rewriting the configs
20:27 &lt;tuomov&gt; but I don't want to have anything to do with that
20:27 &lt;tuomov&gt; and it will also be fucked up, because then float workspaces on 
               the screens won't be properly separate
20:27 &lt;tuomov&gt; it won't emulate separate screens
20:28 &lt;tuomov&gt; shit-o-rama is just _shit_
20:28 &lt;tuomov&gt; it can't work, it won't work. it's as simple as that.
20:28 &lt;tuomov&gt; traditional X multihead offers the correct separate-screen model 
               for displays that don't merge well
20:28 &lt;tuomov&gt; but the dicheads and fuckwits running things, are obsoleting it
20:28 &lt;tuomov&gt; and not updating it to reflect new requirements
20:29 &lt;tuomov&gt; (such as reparents between screens)
