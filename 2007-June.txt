Hi all

Just report if I put LANG=fr_FR.ISO8859-1 export LANG in my .xession the
?load? fearture in the statusbar don't work. There just (null).

Not very important bug but...well..

I'm running ion-3ds-20070318_1 in FreeBSD box, and ion-3d is installed with
FreeBSD ports.

Regards.

That's when /proc/loadavg does not exist, it parses the output of
the 'uptime' command... in english. I never got around to adding
a getloadavg(3) export to statusd for the script... maybe I should.

Then, $(LC_ALL=C uptime) should do it (?).

Or (temporarily) set LANG=C before executing uptime in
/mod_statusbar/ion-statusd/statusd_load.lua?  Don't know whether or
how this works in lua, though.

Humm....

I'm just a poor sysadmin don't known anything in developpment I can help
you. But if you want some test that's I can. Just tell me i fyou need some
test.

The uptime command work for me what's ever in my LANG.

Sorry, I would like to help but I'm just enought smart to report a bug not to help you... :-(

Subject: ion on mac os x tiger
Message-ID: <b85d58c40706041200r7398739ck3662833542b1cf71@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there

I've so far run ion on ubuntu and come to love it -- so much I absolutely
need it on my new workstation, which for random reasons had to be a mac.

All compiles happily, but I then don't know how to get things started. I'd
really appreciate any help a lot... Thanks. So:

I first tried to log into console, run x11 (xinit) from there and then run
ion on it, but it generates errors, and then leaves me with a blue screen
that is utterly unresponsive to anything, incluing ctrl-alt-backspace etc.

So I tried the following, while running the standard mac os x window
manager:

First start an x server on display 1 by doing

      xinit -- :1

And then run ion on that display:

     ion -display :1

But that won't work, and it comes up with all kinds of errors:

Quentin,

I'm running ion on a powerbook g4 with Mac OS X 10.4
and using the XDarwin installed via the xorg packages in
Fink. I used to use the X11.app that Apple supplies, but I
found it a bit unstable. In either case, you start the X server
by starting the .app application, not by running some
command directly. You can always put the app in your
autostart list.

You may have some trouble with the keyboard - both
X servers provide options for setting the keyboard map
and you might also have add to some stuff to your
~/.Xmodmap. I can post mine if it will help, but be warned
that I don't think either X server actually implements the
keyboard mappings correctly - I haven't been able to get
it to work exactly as I want even after lots of messing
around with xev, .Xmodmap etc.

Anyway, this is my ~/.xinit (or at least the relevant parts of it).

Hope it's useful

Samer.


--------------------------------------------------
usermodmap=$HOME/.Xmodmap

# don't forget system/user resources..

if [ -f $usermodmap ]; then
     echo Installing user modmap from $usermodmap
     xmodmap $usermodmap
fi

# set X11 font paths
xset fp+ ~/Library/Fonts/artwiz-aleczapka-en-1.3
xset fp+ /sw/lib/X11/fonts/misc
xset fp rehash

# this might cause font problems depending on which X server you use

I don't know how to do what you want, but I think I know what you
mean. If I'm right, perhaps my explanation will help someone else help
you. So here is the situation you seem to be talking about:

1. Two IM-related windows are already open: a buddy list and a
conversation. They are in two different frames.
2. The conversation window is hidden by another window in its frame.
3. When the buddy list window gains focus, you want the conversation
window to become the visible window in its frame.

This is some BSD-inherited symbol mangling brain damage.
(libdl and gcc/linker not agreeing whether it should be done.) 
Try linking statically (the PRELOAD_MODULES setting).

Hello,

looking at mod_sp_set_shown_on code, it seems it returns TRUE even
when it actually hides the scratchpad, whereas the documentation says
"The resulting status is returned."

This prevents me from using this return value is custom lua code.

On OS X, you'll need PRELOAD_MODULES, EXTRA_LIBS+=-lintl but you need to 
kill the -lrt part.
For those willing to compile the latest version, you'll also need a 
patch for signal.c. I uploaded a trivial one at [1].

Subject: ion3 RC backports for Debian etch
Message-ID: <851wgcotcp.fsf@boum.org>

Hello,

I?m maintaining backports for Debian etch of Debian unstable ion3-*
packages : https://intrigeri.boum.org/debian/

I?ll update them reasonably quickly when Debian unstable packages are
themselves updated. They are built for i386, a bit later for powerpc,
and the source packages are of course available.

I?ll go on with this work as long as I materially can, until Ben or
another Debian developer takes responsibility of maintaining backports
on backports.org, volatile.debian.org, or wherever.

As strongly stated on my Debian packages page, these packages are
usually somehow outdated in regard to upstream (pre-)releases : they
are thus not supported upstream, so *please do not report any bug
about these packages to the Ion author*. Really. My Debian packages
page also explains the current RC-nature of ion3.

Which is a good reason to not include them on bpo. I really should remove
this package with this really braindead author.

Which should happen this week.  I am currently busy with DebConf video

<snip>

Only packages in testing should have backports on backports.org.  Ion3
is blocked from propagating into testing (by #415287) until there is a
stable release of Ion3 that can be supported in a stable release of
Debian.  However, since I normally run stable myself, I normally ensure
that my packages will build on both stable and unstable, making it
trivial to backport them.

Subject: ion on mac os x tiger
Message-ID: <ff055fb80706170637u61e91398q9fa054abe25aa623@mail.gmail.com>

Hi keyboard gurus,

I think the default install of x11-wm/ion on Mac OS 10.4 is broken.
Ion installs sucessfully, but produces the following errors:
Ion startup error log:

According to the thread found here:
http://www.mail-archive.com/ion-general at lists.berlios.de/msg02067.html
the problem can be fixed by turning off dynamic linking. I tried to do this
by changing /sw/fink/10.4/unstable/main/finkinfo/x11-wm/ion.info as follows:


[...]
Revision: 2
[...]
ConfigureParams: --with-lua-prefix=%p --mandir=%p/share/man
--infodir=%p/share/\
info --libexecdir=%p/sbin --with-libtool=%p --with-disable-shared
[...]

however, even with the --diable-shared flag (found in the configure file of
the current ion-2 source package),

fink rebuild ion
fink reinstall ion

did not produce a working ion install.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

With help of deryni (Etan Reisner) I found the problem. Attached patch

I've searched in the ion-general mailing-lists but I didn't found

I've probed the xprop but it isn't differences the main (firefox)

How can I handle it?
/I want to place in other frame/

I'm using ion2, 20040729.

This is some *BSD legacy brain damage, gcc/linker/libdl not agreeing on

That's because it now uses getloadavg(3) instead of the uptime command.

hi,

I upgraded to 3rc-20070608 yesterday and everything runs just fine except
the statusbar where the time is only updated on startup or restart of `ion3'.
once it's there no updates occur. same with the load meters. this occurs even
with the "factory setup" (i.e. without a custom `.ion3' directory).

to be complete:
the only thing which went not through smoothly during ugrade was a (apparently
not relevant) complain with regards to an acompanying libiconv upgrade, so a
slightly older libiconv is still in effect.

platform: mac g5, MacOS 10.4.9

any ideas more specific than RTFM or RTFSC?

regards,

joerg

Could it be that this piece of crapware defines _POSIX_MONOTONIC_CLOCK,
but does not actually implement it? That (a clock that advances 
predictably) is an essential feature that any operating system that
isn't totally moronic should have had to  begin with... or alternatively
an unlimited number of timer signals.

Yes, it defines it as -1. See the trivial patch I sent in the 'Re: ion

which means master valkonen might integrate this patch if he deems such
a thing tolerable and the clock will tick happily away again?  

or have I to notify steve jobs that MacOS is as rotten as an old wet mold-covered 
piece of wood and even worse than {insert_each+any_other_OS_here_as_far_as_I_understand_tuomo}?
not that this would get the clock running, though...

but `crapware' is nice. opens up a whole new field of insults (how about, e.g.
`pukeware').

They could start by stopping to claim that it is there. All the
documentation I have found says either that a) _POSIX_MONOTONIC_CLOCK
is defined when CLOCK_MONOTONIC is available, or b) must be defined
to the value 200112L (or so). I'd prefer the latter (since it's a
POSIX version check too), but glibc is also crapware, and the header
/usr/include/bits/posix_opt.h simply defines:

/* The monotonic clock might be available.  */ 
#define _POSIX_MONOTONIC_CLOCK  0

Note the moronic "might".

But, oh, in the world of FOSS herdware it is _forbidden_ for things to
work just like that: you're supposed to use autocrap scripts (broken
and unmaintainable themselves) to test for every possible form of brain
damage the author of some other piece of software -- and distributors --
might be suffering from.

yes. but would/could you integrate pierre's patch nevertheless (for the time
being, that is: I've heard that apple promises major improvements w.r.t. POSIX
compliance and such with the next major OS upgrade -- which, on the other hand,
needs not to be true, of course)?

No. I just added a check for EINVAL return value.. which should
be more reliable supposing some system isn't so utterly and 
totally brain dead, that it defines _POSIX_MONOTONIC_CLOCK, but 
does not even define clock_gettime and CLOCK_MONOTONIC... or
does not return an error when the clock doesn't exist. 
I wouldn't put it past the kind of crapware most software 
these days is.

Hi,

Can someone give me a status update on the latest Xinerama support?
Just a few lines, whether it works or if it's broken. Depending on the
answer I might want to bump my xft patches to the latest RC and create
a separate distribution tar ball.

Do you think to this:
http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/faq/entries/GTK2_focus_bug.html
?

(google/linux has 0 results to gnomefox and the "simple" google gives
this as the first hit ;)

Sorry, can you explain it? What does it mean "fix gnomefox"?
I've applied the patch on
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143349 but no changes :(
I'm using gtk+ 2.11.4.

It works for me with the latest rc, after being broken in the one
before.

I believe he means that you would need to modify Firefox to apply
different window properties to each window.  This is somewhat
complicated because the C++ code that creates the dialogs may likely not
know anything about what its purpose will be, while the JavaScript code
(the UI of Mozilla browsers is written in JavaScript, essentially) that
actually knows the purpose of the window doesn't know anything about
X11, and thus isn't prepared to set specific window properties.

One hack may be to match the title of the window somehow.

OK. I understand :(
I'm using a LFS so I compile all from sources.

But I'm using some gtk2 applications (transmission, liferea,...), so
the dialogs don't work with ion :(
A little bit uncomfortable, but I bear it...

Thanks.

Zsolt
