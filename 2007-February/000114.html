well, in case someone is not aware of it: for xterm and the like
(and every 'sufficiently standard' terminal emulator (say, `rxvt')
there is at least always the possibility to use some escape
sequences to directly write into the title bar and use 
this facility within some aliases to get meaningful headings.
so, one does not need specific shells to do this.

e.g., I use tcsh and have set the following in `.cshrc`
(would be rather similar with bash and `.profile')

alias label   'echo -n &quot;]2;\!*&quot;'
alias cd      'cd \!*;label &quot;$hostbasename&quot;:$PWD'

don't know, how the above comes across via mail but in
the  first line the `echo` command uses
&lt;ESC&gt;]2 (escape right bracket followed by `2;')
and than inserts some text (placeholder \!*)
given on the command line, e.g. 

label &quot;my_title&quot;

and than ends with &lt;CTRL&gt;G

I don't remember, but it is somewhere in the xterm-docs or on the net
what escape sequences excactly are understood by xterm.

in effect, this allows to set the title bar text with
the `label' alias. more importantly, the `cd' alias sets the
title bar automatically to the current machine and directory 
after each `cd' command. 
the latter serves me fine 99% of the time (for the rest
the `label' command is OK. of course one can construct one's
own favorite information which should be dumped into the
title bar with appropriate modification of the above.

maybe this is of use for someone.
