<PRE>Sorry, but I'm really not following the focus of the conversation here.
Tuomo explicitly gave his opinions on the direction that ion3 development
should be going, so It seems pretty simple to me: Given the options of WMs,
you use Ion if you WANT to. Not only that, Tuomo gave an explanation on his
choices.

I've tried different tilling window managers, and my 2 cents are:

Awesome(3): is becoming huge project and has alot of &quot;enhancements&quot; over Ion
but at each new version, the config files change and all that backward
incompatibilties arise.

Xmonad: Very well written, fast, and customizable. But since it's
Haskell-based, you have to install a metric shitload of Haskell
dependencies.

dwm: You have to recompile it every time you change something. It's just not
versatile enough for my tastes.

stumpwm, scrotwm, wmii: never tried, will not speculate over those.


In the end, it all boils down to how much you want to customize your WM.
Then, it's all about programing language taste.

</I>&gt;<i> very powerful and flexible, but wouldn't recommend this one to new
</I>&gt;<i> users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> StumpWM (as of 2 months ago): pretty good feature-wise, does almost
</I>&gt;<i> everything OK, very slow if you don't fine-tune the VM.  If you don't
</I>&gt;<i> know Common Lisp it will be very confusing.  I like Lisp so it was OK
</I>&gt;<i> for me.  Also it doesn't integrate with Gnome well.  Installation is OK
</I>&gt;<i> with Ubuntu.  I would have loved to recommend this one because Lisp is
</I>&gt;<i> so flexible but it's just not for everyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> XMonad: really good in every way, configuring beyond the basics requires
</I>&gt;<i> learning Haskell.  To me that was actually a plus, I like Haskell a lot
</I>&gt;<i> but certainly it's not for everyone.  This one is very fast, has
</I>&gt;<i> multiple layouts besides tabbed (full screen, side by side, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> Supports floating windows, integrates well with Gnome.  Extending it is
</I>&gt;<i> easy.  Installation is really easy with Ubuntu and the docs are good
</I>&gt;<i> (lots of sample configs and every module is documented).  I'd recommend
</I>&gt;<i> this one to people looking to try a new WM, unless they want deep
</I>&gt;<i> customization and Haskell is outside their comfort zone.
