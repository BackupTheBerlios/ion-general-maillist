jm&gt; But the configuration files aren't that hard really, they're well documented, both
jm&gt; in the manual and in the files themselves. They are very easy to edit by basically
jm&gt; anyone who understands variable=setting, because this is what they are. They're
jm&gt; hardly code, they're just function calls. And can easily be edited by just reading
jm&gt; the comments and bdoc and then deciding to which button you want to have that
jm&gt; feature, and then edit that to the button you want. You don't even have to understand
jm&gt; lua or ion or code at all.

jm&gt; And anyway, Lua was *designed* to be embedded in ways like this. That's also the
jm&gt; reason alot of games use Lua for scripting and configuration.  If you know just a
jm&gt; litle bit of lua and a litle bit ion you can really make ion much better then just
jm&gt; the defaults by making small scripts/functions that do stuff. And the reason for
jm&gt; this is that you can bind any lua (or even C) function you write to a key thanks
jm&gt; to the easy-to-use-but-powerful-config files.  Taking this away would take alot
jm&gt; of fun from ion.

I am not saying the powerful Lua interface should be removed.  There
should just be a way for novices to get started without the fear of
breaking their configuration.  The tool I'm suggesting would only allow
key binding to simple functions, nothing more.  Here are the functions I
use most often, personally (I use tiled workspaces all the time):

go to workspace 0..8
split here H/V
split at top level H/V
switch tab next/previous
navigate up/down in a V split
navigate left/right in a H split
tag
attach tagged
cycle windows
close window
key X = run command Y

Does this list look complete for a beginner?
