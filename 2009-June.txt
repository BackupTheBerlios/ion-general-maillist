Hi,

Since I do not like having empty frames on my screen, I figured I'll try and 
write a small function that would close the frame if I close the last client 
in a frame. This is the (wrong) code I came up with. Could not find a better 
way than this io.write thing to debug what was going on.

function close_test(wmp)
    local c = WMPlex.mx_count(wmp)
    io.output("/tmp/dbg.ionscript")
    io.write("Number of children: ", c, ".\n")
    if WRegion.rqclose_propagate(wmp, _sub) then
        io.write("Closed one child.\n")
        if c == 1 then
            while WMPlex.mx_count(wmp) == 1 do
                io.write("Still one child seen.\n")
            end
            WRegion.rqclose(wmp)
        end
    end
end

... and as I half expected - this goes into an infinite loop when I try and 
use it on a frame in which there is only one client (and the client is not 
destroyed).

I am sure Ion3 can do what I want... but could someone tell me what is wrong 
with my script, and what is the proper way, if any to make this function not 
blocking?

Looks like a hook (deinit ?) is probably what I really need, but I am afraid 
I might run into the same type of issue. And all my feebles attempts to 
implement hooks so far miserably failed.

Thanks,

Seb

PS: I am using ion3-20090110.

rqclose is asynchronous. Generally, the code should return to the 
main loop for the actions to take effect; and for client windows,
you have to wait for the client to take action, if it does. Ion can
only get to know of this, when it returns to the... main loop.

You should listen to frame_managed_changed_hook. No need to make
new bindings, just check when a frame becomes empty in that hook.
min_tabs.lua from the scripts repository might provide some useful
bits.

If you restart/quit properly, i.e., though Ion's menus/functions,
instead of simply killing X (C-A-BS).

Thanks - I did just this, but face yet another issue, this time with the 
below code:

local function close_empty_frame(ftable)
    if ftable.mode ~= 'remove' then return end
    local wmp = ftable.reg
    -- Should probably test that wmp is not nil here - or is it guaranteed 
to contain sth meaningful ?
    if WMPlex.mx_count(wmp) == 0 then
        ioncore.defer(WRegion.rqclose(wmp))
    end
end

local hk=ioncore.get_hook("frame_managed_changed_hook")
hk:add(close_empty_frame)

Now the code does not hang anymore, but I get "ion3: Attempt to call an 
unsafe function "rqclose" in restricted mode." each time I close the last 
client in a frame.

I thought ioncore.defer would do the trick and defer the execution of the 
rqclose until I am back in the main loop (so probably out of "restricted" 
mode), but it looks like it does not... What am I still missing ?

ioncore.defer takes a _function_. In your code WRegion.rqclose(wmp) will  
be executed and the result will be passed to defer.

You need to wrap the function call in a lamba like this:
   ioncore.defer(function () WRegion.rqclose(wmp) end)

Working fine - thank you.

BTW, I also had to change the default behaviour of the splitting bindings.
By default, they have the 'attach_current' parameter set to true. This
prevented splitting a frame which had only one client: the frame was split,
the only client of the  previous frame was moved to the new split, the hook
triggered and the previous frame (now empty) was destroyed.
In this situation, I would see is the frame briefly flashing, but no split
occurring.

Changing the default split binding to use 'attach_current' false fixed this.

Thanks a lot for your answers,

Seb

I find that tiling w/o tabbing is rather useless.
And it's the tabbing part that takes extra effort to
implement under Windows. Under X, the WM can -- still
as of June 2009 -- reparent application windows within
its own windows, and draw the decorations in its frame
windows. Under Windows, applications always create 
top-level windows, which are divided into "client area"
and the remaining boundary, that is drawn by the "system"
-- whatever part that is. You'd somehow have to replace 
that "system" to draw different kind of decorations and
add different kind of controls, which are duplicated
between all the windows associated to a pseudo-frame/
tabbed set. Of course, further problems arise because
many applications seem to override the "system", and
draw their own decorations... and then there's the
issue of the apparent lack of the equivalent of the
ICCCM, so you can't enforce tiling... as far as I know,
but I'm no WinAPI expert.

I received your first answer.  Check your list subscription information
and your mail user agent configuration to find what's behaving
differently than you expect?  Many mailing lists by default don't send

Subject: Ion wiki?
Message-ID: <op.uu8h56x2vocxtk@tabole-debian>

I have very limited experience with web services and hosting, but I've set
up a temporary
dokuwiki [1] at http://folk.ntnu.no/bronner/ion3wiki
(Temporary as in I don't really have a proper host. Maybe someone else
has?)

My thought is that the wiki can contain an extended FAQ, further
documentation of lua scripting, and maybe some guide to the C code base.
(and other stuff people want there of course)
It could also serve as a temporary home for new user scripts / patches to
existing ones until the source control issue is resolved.

Suggestions and comments are welcome. eg. if dokuwiki a good choice?

Maybe you an just use some of the hosting services? (sf.net, berlios, etc.)
Ion of course has a berlios account for this mailing list, and in theory
a wiki could be hosted on that account... but I don't support webshit-only
wikis, and I don't think it's right for an unofficial wiki to appear at
a semi-official address.
