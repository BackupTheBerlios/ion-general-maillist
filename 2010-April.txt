Subject: so, what now?
Message-ID: <1270421671.9117.103.camel@localhost>

now that tuomov has finally severed his last remaining connection with
ion, what do we (committed ion users) do now? 

I spent the last few days committedly trying out other WMs, and i can
say this with absolute certainty: there's nothing out there that's even
comparable! (the closest thing i could find, in terms of
what-you-can-do, was 'awesome', but it subscribes to a very different
philosophy than ion's, and is kind of a mess)

so, I need to hear some ideas about the future of this project (not
simply suggestions for other WM's; i will NOT switch to anything that's
currently on the market, and that's my final decision!), I do have a few
ideas of my own, but i want to know what everybody else thinks; after
all, I'm just new-comer compared to the majority of the remaining users
here (been using Ion for only a few months now), I don't know anything
about the community (or what's left of it), how it works, or how the
author's actions affected it. so i think it's best of somebody else took
the initiative and got this conversation going...

M Rawash

Firstly, why not to fork ion3 to add needed functionality? (i do not know is there any 'no forks' etc in it's license because the ion3's page is down)
Secondly, there was some project like 'ion3 with scripts in python but without tuomo', unfortunately i can not give you it's name or link to it. It was dead when i lurked about it, but it has no licensing problems - so you can just fork it and write the code you need. 
Also, i know that xmonad or stumpwm could both be a good alternative for the static-frames-with-tabs wm behavior, first only after huge code-writing using the existing modules (XMonad.Tabs), and second pretty out-of-box - only one thing bothers me - for both of them i need to learn completely unknowm programming languages - so i'm stick with ion, too. And both of them lack for scratchpad-like function, while i'm using it.
But i do not see any argument why i should ever bother finding alternative to ion, e.g. - it has all the functions i need, out-of-the-box or with plugins, it is stable, it builds with current x-libraries, etc.

The last version of the licence can be seen at:

http://git.decadent.org.uk/gitweb?p=ion3.git;a=blob;f=LICENSE;h=fdfa652c68cd5d06ec2383e7ea4429e6dc5cb4d0;hb=e3aec18706513a87eaa7839dfdaf7e0fcd0d8d2a

You can fork it but then you must rename it.  Tuomo said in the past
that this included functional use of the name 'Ion' such as in the
installation directories.  This restriction was introduced in the
copyright licence of ion-3rc-20070506; if you fork an earlier version
then you should only have to consider trademark rights.

I don't think there are any restrictions on forking ion3 (as long as
we're not using the Ion3(tm) name, and adhering to the LGPLv2 licence,
see attachment), actually, I'm surprised there isn't dozens of Ion forks
out there, considering its flexibility, design and the amount of new
concepts it introduced.

well, python is pretty taxing resources-wise, compared to lua, so i
don't see this is a viable alternative to ion, and as i said there
really isn't a problem with forking ion to begin with.

xmonad needs a haskell compiler with an install size of 680MB+, that's
NOT "lightwight"! haskell is not Java, there simply isn't that good a
justification for wasting so much space. as for stumpwm, i remember
trying it some time back, i also remember crashing it far too many times
before finally giving up, it just wasn't stable enough for me...

that's pretty much why i'm sticking with ion too.

Copyright (c) Tuomo Valkonen 1999-2009.

Unless otherwise indicated in components taken from elsewhere, this software
is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 ("LGPL",
reproduced below), extended and modified with the following terms:

  If the name Ion(tm) or other names that can be associated with the Ion
  project are used to distribute this software, then:

    - A version that does not significantly differ from one of the
      copyright holder's releases, must be provided by default.

    - Versions not based on the copyright holder's latest release (on 
      the corresponding "branch", such as Ion3(tm)), must within 28 days
      of this release, be prominently marked as (potentially) obsolete
      and unsupported.

    - Significantly altered versions may be provided only if the user
      explicitly requests for those modifications to be applied, and 
      is prominently notified that the software is no longer considered 
      the standard version, and is not supported by the copyright holder.
      The version string displayed by the program must describe these
      modifications and the "support void" status.

  Versions for which the above conditions are not satisfied, must be
  renamed so that they can not be associated with the Ion project, their
  executables must be given names that do not conflict with the copyright
  holder's version, and neither the copyright holder nor the Ion project
  may be referred to for support.

  In the text of sections 0-2, 4-12, and 14-16 of the LGPL, "this License" 
  is to be understood to refer to the LGPL extended with these terms and,
  where applicable, possible similar terms related to the names of other
  works forming a whole. Sections 3 and 13 of the LGPL are void. Where
  contradictory, these additional terms take precedence over the LGPL.

End of terms.


Explanations

Trademarks: With the terms above primarily appealing to copyright law,
should any of the indicated trademarks be found invalid, does not excuse
you from the conditions imposed by those terms. The use of these names
in contexts other than redistribution of this software and modifications,
is outside the scope of the terms above, and governed by applicable
trademark or other laws. 

  With regard to modules and other extensions to Ion(tm), the permission
  is hereby granted to use "Ion" as part of the name, provided that it
  occurs in a form suggesting that the work is supported by neither the
  copyright holder nor the Ion project: "Foo for Ion" instead of "Ion Foo",
  etc.

Significant change: Bug fixes are insignificant as additions. Basic changes
that are needed to install or run the software on a target platform, are 
insignificant. Additionally, basic/small configuration changes to better 
integrate the software with the target platform, without obstructing the
standard behaviour, are insignificant. Everything else is significant, 
unless expressly declared otherwise by the copyright holder. 

Distributions: For example, suppose an aggregate distribution of software
provides an `installpkg` command for installing packages. Then the action
`installpkg ion3` (resp. `installpkg ion`) should provide the latest release
of Ion3 (resp. the latest stable release) 28 days from release date at the
latest, or prominently notify the user that the provided version is (likely
to be) obsolete and unsupported. The latest release being provided by
default, or prominently appearing in a listing, constitutes prominent
marking of earlier releases as obsolete. Specific versions (including
modified versions) may be provided if the user explicitly requests for
those, within the constraints set above.

The intent of these terms is to curb the power that "distributions", as
the primary sources of software for many users, have in defining what
is perceived as Ion. By providing significantly modified versions and
out-dated development snapshots without prominently mentioning this fact,
they do not present the work in a light that the author can agree with,
and create a burden of dealing with (new) users seeking for support for
such versions.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must
be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
    performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.


    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
  Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

I think we're all aware that there are other tiling WMs, but that's not
the point; i made it clear in my first post that i want us to discuss
the future of Ion, not the future of ion users! everybody can switch a
non-dead WM if they really want to, but this should be a thread for
people who don't...

here's the archived version of ion's website if anybody is interested:
http://web.archive.org/web/20080516110658/http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/ion/


i'm also interested in getting all the ion3-related code out there, can
somebody help? here's the list of all of tuomo's repos as they stood in
Jan 2007:
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Ywt5AFIyKuUJ:www.modeemi.fi/~tuomov/repos/+www.modeemi.fi/~tuomov/repos&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&ie=UTF-8

i already have ion-3plus, ion-doc-3, ion-scripts-3, libextl-3 and
libtu-3, and i'll probably be uploading them to git a repo soon. i'd
like to get mod_ionflux-3, mod_xrandr-3 (especially the former)

I think it would be appropriate to establish a new mailing list
ASAP instead of discussing the details of a fork here.

Well, ion is mostly stable and complete, but it does have some problems with certain software (java software particularly) and, if I've understood correctly, it's desirable to get better multihead support. It would be fun to see a graphic engine with support for icons/more control over individual tab colors too.

How many are familiar at all with the source? I've poked around quite a bit, and uses a slightly modified ion3-plus daily. I don't have much time in the nearest future however.

this is right next to integration of xrandr on my wishlist

I'm somewhat familiar with the source.  Like you, I don't have
much time presently though. :-(

Here's more from my wishlist:

     * EWMH support to make ion3 integrate more completely in
       desktop environments such as gnome. I wrote a tiny module
       that updates the pager, but it's not sufficient to allow the
       pager to control ion3:

         http://n01se.net/paste/hYW -- ewmh_pager.lua

     * Migrate more core functionality to lua to minimize the
       portion written in C. For example I re-implemented
       maximization in lua because the version in C was too
       limited and wasn't extensible. (This is for floating
       workspaces.) The same module provides sawfish-like window
       pushing and maximize-fill.

         http://n01se.net/paste/JjS -- directions.lua

*The exact* name I had always thought about for an Ion fork, since nothing
fulfils better Tuomo's requirement for substantially different forks not to be
called Ion, i.e. to be called "not Ion". :D

regardless of what ends up being the name, I'd like to suggest that the
name must be an easily searchable word; "notion" isn't, although I like
it.

I also have another suggestion (that suffers from the same problem
stated above): cation.

Hello my dear, suffering comrades,

first of all: I found a recent documentation as PDF in my browser-cache:
http://tmp.uxix.de/ionconf.pdf

Since I am using ion3 (and before...) I am looking for a better
windowmanager, but I couldn't find anything that is even close to being at
least as good as ion3.

I personally would like to have something like awesome is to wmii/dwm for
ion3.

Unfortunatelly I can't call myself a programmer (I do speak a little
Python, but not enough to even know where to start to write a
windowmanager). But I would happily contribute to such a project with
webspace, git/subversion, wiki, mail and other infrastructure, if one
doesn't want to use something like sourceforge or github.

name suggestion: Positron (with a positive attitude! Happy, Happy - Joy,
Joy!)

I would also like to assemble a whole desktop-environment in that style
(PDE) (optionally). I personally don't use ion3 because it is lightweight
but because it is usable (after adding mod_xinerama).

-
	Klaus

I agree, but shouldn't we decide on a name and a project leader before
that move, or are you thinking of something more temporary?

My opinion is - start writing the code and you'll be the leader of your own fork. 
People will like it - people will form a team with you, will send patches, etc.
Vote is useless with no code. Boss with brilliant ideas and no coding skills is useless too.

I think this is how it works with a lot of startup projects and some
offshoot forks (that are often short-lived and completely useless),
which have no established community, where the leader was just there
when everybody came; however, forks that are spawn from the sudden-death
of a project, like what we're trying to establish here, and like a few
success stories i personally witnessed
( http://foswiki.org/About/WhyThisFork ), are different, they require a
lot of coordinated work, where the process becomes more democratic and
the leader doesn't have to be the best coder, maybe just a good leader
with some experience (and of course, full awareness of what he's getting
himself into). 

just my tuppence...

I personally don't think that's really an issue. People will
inevitably search for "notion window manager" and that will work.

I agree. Ion3 currently beats them all although it has it's problems.

Does anyone know how to get the source? Last time I checked the webpage
it was down.

No way!, I want not-ion to be a sucess!Evenmore, my skills in Lua are none and I'm far away from what a leader should be.Still, I have seen the things to change, do you thing that it is a good idea to fork?I don't see the need. There is nobody who is a dictatorinside this project.couldn't we update the source of Ion and keep Tuomo work? because it's rock solid...

I don't have the ion-3 and mod_xrandr-3 repositories. I'm not certain that the repos are complete either (ie. checked out with --complete). Does anyone know how to check this?

Only a temporally mirror though. (uni account might expire in a year or so)

Does anybody have ion3-scripts fresh repository? Please share it.

mod_xkb.c is especially needed.

absolutely, I don't think we have a choice, it's either that or ion is
dead forever.

Tuomo's work will remain the base of any future development 
(at least for the foreseeable future), a fork doesn't mean a complete
rewrite!

exactly, if this was really an issue, awesome users should be the first

great, please upload libextl and libtu (see attachment), because we need

First, thanks for starting this thread! I did notice that Tuomov's pages
were down, but since his whole site was down, I was waiting for it to
come back without realizing he might have taken the whole project down.
Quick question: do we know for sure Tuomov has severed connections with
ion3 permanently or is this our best guess at this point?

ion3 has been my primary environment for a while now, and I won't
consider changing. I love its design, philosophy, and simplicity, but
I'm preaching to the choir here.

I'm all for forking into /one/ fork, and that too only because of the
licensing issue--please lets not make multiple messy forks. Like a few
of you, I don't have much time either right now, but expect to be able
to contribute a more a few months down the line. But I can contribute
towards getting us going right now if needed.

We have at least a few tasks to accomplish ASAP just so we don't lose
continuity or momentum (please suggest other things that need to be done
too):

- We need a new name and so far, I personally like both "notion" (my top
   favorite) and "neon". Do we have any other nominations? Note that we
   can always change the name later. It's good to get moving on things
   even based on a temporary name if we can't reach consensus.

- We need to get the codebase including the latest set of sources (easy,
   many of us have this), and also as much of the associated git repos as
   we can.

- We need a central place to get ourselves organized and store code. I

   I've speculatively created a new 'notion' project (we can change name,

- We need 2 or 3 managers and/or lead devlopers. IMHO, managers do not

Message-ID: <20100406184118.e31f52ef.a.rink@gmx.net>

Hello,
I'm very happy to see that I am not the only one who is using ion3 and thinks about the future (I already posted about this at the archlinux forums). I fully support the idea of forking it, choosing a new project name and continuing the development.

I would suggest the following name:
- nion (interesting about this name is, while it would be an acronym for not-ion, it is also the irish name of the fifth letter of the Ogham alphabet an probably meaning "fork" as I read at wikipedia and what we are doing here is a fork, isn't it? :) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nion)

If I could be of any help (e.g. taking one of the managing positions Timandahaf mentioned), I would be glad to do it.

Best regards

all repos are uploaded here (with the exception of 'mod_xrandr-3', which
was obsolete, AFAIK): http://github.com/gwash

libextl-3 and libtu-3 are missing their makefiles for some reason (you
can still get them from ion-3 stable).

"notion" seems to get the most support amongst those who posted so
far...

i was thinking more of googlecode (easier to set-up and get running, and
it has a forum/mailinglist of some sort), but i guess sourceforge is
good too..

I agree, and so far we have one volunteer (Alexander Rink, up there),
anyone else?

I was just concerned that it might be disrespectful to discuss on
this list modifications that are anathema to Tuomo's wishes.
However I agree that choosing a name, at least, is pretty
important to setting up a new mailing list... :-)

While I have great appreciation for Tuomo's work, I don't think
the answer to this question matters to me personally. I am hoping
this fork will succeed because I want to pursue functionality
that has so far been blocked (xinerama, xrandr, xft,
iconization, EWMH, built-in support for idiosynchratic
applications, etc).

I've liked a number of suggestions, including particleman, but
notion remains my first choice.

I think we should put the current source as-is in a repo, then do
a massive s/ion3/newname/ and modify the top-level documentation
to mention our debt to Tuomo and the heritage of the project,
while pointing users away from Tuomo and to a new bug tracker and
mailing list.

In other words I think the pristine source should be the first
commit to the repo, so even the initial modifications (including
the name change) are recorded.

We should plan to make a first release within a couple months,
containing the simple combination of renamed-ion3 with the
existing out-of-tree modules we collect. Releasing early before
going into more serious development should help us gain momentum
quickly.

I will be happy to contribute on both fronts after a couple
weeks. Right now I'm in crunch mode toward releasing a product at
work so I won't be able to immediately commit any substantial
time toward notion.

fwiw I think development going forward would be easier if most of
that stuff was organized into a single repo. I believe in the
value of logical separation, but having lots of repos isn't
necessary to achieve that, it just makes life harder with
multiple simultaneous releases. Consider that libtu and libextl
exist solely for ion3...

Tuomo responded to an email on this list on March 22.  Maybe he's just 
on vacation.   He's complained often about the lack of good, simple web 
hosting.  Seems slightly hasty to not wait to hear from the man himself 
that the project is "abandoned"-abandoned (as opposed to "I've switched 
to Windows, and don't plan to support this").

Personally, I don't understand everyone's reluctance to even consider 
changing.  Ion's great 'n all, but without extremely committed 
leadership, there doesn't seem to be much point to forking.  (Either it 
will remain the useful tool it is and only get bugfixes, or it'll bitrot 
completely.)  Why not branch out and get other similar-minded window 
managers (under active development) to incorporate some of what you love 
about ion?

Guessing that won't be a popular sentiment, but whatever.  Not trying to 
completely discourage anyone -- just adding my $.02.

My favorite, too.

Good luck to anyone willing to commit the time it's gonna take.

i agree, and these are just backups of the old darcs repos, no future
development or branching is meant to take place there.

true, that's why i think it's best if we left the development discussion
for a later session, right now we should focus on organisation and
getting something tangible up and running.

Tuomo's website 404'd, the rest of the (host) website and all the other
accounts look pretty fine to me, doesn't seem like a problem with the
host at all (although it's still possible).

i believe forking was already on a lot of people's minds for some time
now (as somebody else mentioned), the fact that the website is no longer
available merely served as a motivation.

nope he doesnt, for me. tuomo always has had good argumentation to his
writings.  (well, i did not read mailing list a lot, cause i've had no
real problems, but his blag was well-argumented and pretty logical).
And, i'm agree with lots of things that real tuomo said.

The hosting is from "club" for computer science stundents so it might
be possible that for some reason Tuomo is changing hosting, but I would
like to hear the answer from himself.

IIRC, there's a (sub)section in the LGPL that requires us to do so, i

i wouldn't say "always", but yes, sometimes his arguments make sense,
too much sense in fact, it makes us question the real world.

I'm in the same situation. I use ion3 every day, but I'm not a programmer

I'm totally agree with you. 

I'm using FreeBSD and when Tuomov tell FreeBSD team to remove the ion3
ports (package system under FreeBSD) i'm trying many other WM. And my
conclusion is : At this moment all other WM ... sucks.

Too much of the blue pill can do this to a person.

Bad choice of words on my part: by 'web hosting', I didn't mean the 
server -- I meant the software, e.g.:

http://www.mail-archive.com/ion-general at lists.berlios.de/msg03126.html

Yep.  Seems reasonable, despite Fake Tuomo's proclamations (ha).

Not sure if that's sarcastic.  Doesn't make sense if it is.  My point 
was that moving on might be more fruitful than treading water.

Touch?.

Guess I'll go back to lurking.  (I'm only still here for the occasional 
Tuomo rant.)

Also a good point.

I use Windows. I have only been in Finland three months during
the last year. I'm running out of material.

(Although I could rant about software bloat and ever diminishing
laptop screen heights, etc., which make it impossible to work
around bloatware the brute force way of adding ever more hardware.
But I can't be arsed. Oh, how fscking difficult it's to buy 
a summer jacket these days: almost everything is full of plastic.
I hate plastic noise. I hate plastic against skin.)

I thought cation would good - somebody suggested it earlier I think.
A cation is a positive ion for happy smiley people. All the grumps can
start their own fork and call it 'anion'.

Pretty close to the real thing but it was lacking a few key things:

A complete and total bashing of anyone that drives a car, because of
course, roads are only for bikes

A link to the UnEncyclopedia article on Gnome

At least fifteen references to FOSS and how it is ruining every aspect of Linux

An update on XOrg's quest for world domination (I bet those blasted
XOrg developers drive cars!)

And finally a two or three paragraph writeup on how great Windows is.

I do fear that, without a proper outlet for his random thoughts and
ravings, the real Tuomo might explode into a rant on how modern
laptops are to glossy, in front of a group of unsuspecting senior
citizens that are out for a peacful walk.

It seems that most of the recent participants of this mailing list prefer notion as the name for the forking project. But there were other proposals like cation or nion. Should we do an "official" voting (maybe by just by replying to this email with +1 for this or for that) or is the name notion now considered a given?

Hope that we get the ball rolling after this decision has been made...next will be choosing a project leader (i would vote for Timandahaf) / chief developer (I would vote for M Rawash here), but this should be done in another thread...

thanks for starting this, "notion" has got a serious challenger now,
"cation" (i don't get it!), so i agree, it's time to put it to a vote;
mine goes to "notion" so: 

+1 for notion

and just for reference, here are all the current contenders:

- notion
- cation
- nion
- neon
- ion-ng
- particleman

yes, this should definitely be discussed later, right now we just need a
name.

I know in this situation it is relatively safe to assume the trademark
holder isn't hostile, but I would still think it would be very
desirable to have a name that doesn't technically infringe the
trademark.

Unfortunately I don't have much in the way of alternatives to offer,
I'm not particularly good with coming up with names. ThinWM?
TinyParticle? TilingMadeSimple? Quirk? (Told you I was terrible.)

Tumov, I just wanted to express my heartfelt thanks for creating ion3
and making it available.  I've been an ion3 user for 3 years now, and
I don't plan on stopping anyttime soon.

A fork supporting MODERN CRAP(tm) won't be Ion, so you will stop 
using it.

What counts as an association? notion, ion-ng, nion, cation

Can the custom LGPL additions in the license be removed from a fork fulfilling the terms?
The additions doesn't really make sense in a renamed fork, but I'm not really a lawyer..

Any comments Tuomo? I assume you are unwilling to revert the license, even if we ask nicely? :)

Maybe this has been discussed before too?

well, yes, some of these of names do suffer from what you're describing
here (i.e. ion-ng), but i don't think names like "notion" or "neon" can
be mistaken for a trademark infringement (both are common nouns in the
english language, which is not associated with ion(tm))

seconded (except for the "3 years" part, more like 3 months for me..)

Hi,

what's wrong with ion3plus ?

I think Tuomo made it clear in an older mail (see[1] ) how things
should be carried on.
If I got it wrong I stand corrected.

IMO, having new random features in, does not mean immediate success.
See the failure of wmii which every time I gave it a shot it blew out on me.

I guess porting(see [1]) would require the least effort from
developers getting in touch with ion3 code
(and maybe easier to get Tuomo to try it :D)


nIon: +1

I use Windows, and am not coming back.

Even when I have to use Failnux[1], all
all I care anymore is that I get tolerable
fonts, decent keymap, joe, LaTeX, a PDF[2]
viewer, and Opera running. And can somehow 
mount my USB stick without waiting for some
bloated file manager to load a minute. [3]
I just can't be arsed even tying to get Ion
running on the pile of failure that Modern
Linux is: not an _alternative_ to Windows,
but a bug-infested clone.

[1] As the OpenNightmare on the box at the office,
which is fortunately not my nightmare, but the
sysadmin's... I would never even consider trying 
to run such overcomplex grease-fed bug-plantations 
as Modern Linux on my personal computer. Windows 
is much less pain.

[2] KPDF used to be tolerable. Okular is a pile
screen estate wasting crap.

[3] They used to have an automounter on an older
version on OpenNightmare, but no sane way to unmount.
In new version even automount was removed.

These guidelines are there to keep the project
true to the name Ion, and therefore include

[...]

  * A veto for me for major changes that do not simply enhance
    existing features. XFascistType and Shitorama have snowball's
    chance in hell of getting into Ion. Ion runs on pure X11, not
    fugly complex extensions.

[...]

As for development after Ion3plus, which shouldn't _fundamentally_ stray
too far from Ion3, I have some new ideas to try for Ion4, that I'd still
like to see implemented. I just doubt I'm going to do it myself...

[...]

I would also require at that point that Ion be ported to Windows and,
why not, OS X at.
"

well, unless tuomo wears a red coat and lives in the north pole, i don't
see this as a good/fair management model, keeping the Ion(tm) name is
not worth having Tuomo as a lead non-developer...IMO


> IMO, having new random features in, does not mean immediate success.
> See the failure of wmii which every time I gave it a shot it blew out on me.

we agreed to leave the development discussion for a later session, i
don't think we ought to be making any assumptions at this point.

porting or not, 'someone' will have to do it...

although, i'm not sure that's such a big problem (a lot of software
share the same name), i just wanted to bring everybody's attention to

Good point, thanks for pointing this out. We should keep this in mind.

However, I agree with your remark on the trademark holder's hostility,
and also think that the substring 'ion' is the suffix of so many words
in English, that unless we hyphenate it (like "not-ion") or refer to
ion3 (like "notion3"), we should be okay.

Both done.

At this point, we can start getting our code base in. But we must first
sort our the naming issue: there was some discussion about whether or
not our initial commit can have the string "ion3" in it. Any legal
experts here who can comment on this?

here's the vote count as it stands now (based on all posts, not just
replies in this thread/one person, one vote, per name): 
- notion (8)
- cation (4)
- nion (5)
- neon (2)
- ion-ng (1)
- particleman (1)
- JPO (1)

i wouldn't say it's a "notion" blow out, but it's a win nonetheless.

now, if nobody will contest these results and/or question my
methodology, shouldn't it be time that we get down to some real business
(i.e. website/mailinglists/repos/etc..)?

regards,
M Rawash

---
PS: you can still vote for other names on the above list or suggest your
own (personally, i'm still torn between "notion" & "nion"), there's
still a slim chance that "notion" might be a temporary name.

thanks, i'm still not sure what my jurisdictions are, like, can i create
mailinglists (does sourceforge even provide this, or do we have to use
another host), edit HTML, commit to repos, etc..?

IMO, this should be discussed later (preferably, on our own mailinglist,
once we have one that is), right now, i guess, people just want to see
something done, a mailinglist should be a huge moral boost (ME THINKS),
we should start with that; i suggest: [notion-general] & [notion-dev]

any idea how to do this?

Calm down now :).
All the suppositions/proposals I made were made to favor good directions
from Tuomo as we saw he's still around.
 Tearing apart what Tuomo did in years might not be all that good for
future.
 As for the assumption  "not worth having Tuomo as a lead
non-developer...IMO", see other
projects such as Vim, or crappy Linux, where the leaders barely contribute
to the project. Instead they guide it.

Over and out.

AFAIK we don't. He might just be on holidays and the site have went down by coincident.

BUT, regardless of that, he has clearly expressed that he wont develop ion anymore, so we need a maintenance plan. It would be best if we could get Tuomo's blessing to not change the name though.

Actually it does not matter who the leader is if we choose well
appointed strategy for the project.

Tuomo can say "No Xinerama and EWMH", I say "Yes EWMH and Xinerama
doesn't matter to me", and somebody can say "Xinerama is important but I
don't care about EWMH" and so on.

Let's discuss what will we do, then we choose the messiah.

Possibly, but it might be worth considering choosing another
benevolent dictator and letting them have the final say on design
matters on the fork. If only to avoid design by comittee.

We can't do anything to avoid this, except making leader post elective.

i think we all made it clear that we appreciate Tuomo's work on Ion, but
he moved on, and so should we...

That wasn't the point, my objection is not that the lead developer won't
be doing any development, rather that it'll be
"Tuomo" (s/non-developer/self-appointed-benevolent-dictator-for-life/)

I'd like to suggest that it would be preferable if the word chosen for 
the new name be easily searchable. That is to say, someone doing a 
search for "notion howto" or "neon howto" are going to get all kinds of

This is a good point, but looking around, I'm not so worried about it:

google: notion howto
about 65,100 results

google: neon howto
about 170,000 results

The notion hits don't look like they make a lot of sense; I suspect real
HOWTOs regarding a window manager named notion would sort quickly to the
top of the list.

The neon hits include a hit about the neon library on the first page.
Unlike the commercial software named notion, which is unlikely to cause
a lot of confusion, neon is a library which is likely to be on many
users' systems [I have it as a dependency of openoffice and subversion
for some reason I'd prefer not to theorize about].

What about "wrtzlpfrpft"? There are no hits yet on google! It uses no
letter, ion uses and it has no vowels, which is a definite point for "not
Finnish".

Today I read about the company Notion Ink that produces (or tries to produce) an tablet pc called Adam:

http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/07/notion-ink-adam-still-alive-working-on-flash-compatibility/

and

http://www.notionink.in

Not sure if this might be a problem...

The way I wrote that was a little confusing. My meaning was (if I can do 
better this time) a search for debian+howto+notion will include any 
howto's for debian where someone had a notion since it's a common 
english word. Doing a search for various terms+notion generally finds 
hits from the presence of a sentence in the page about the notion of 
something or other. You're absolutely right, a legitimate page about a 
project called notion should rise above that sort of thing.

I was not however really thinking of the legitimate site for the 
project. Consider a search for statusbar+notion, lua+notion, 
maximized+notion, keybindings+notion. The point is notion doesn't do a 
very good job of focusing the hits in on this project. A post someone 
makes on their blog regarding their experiences with notion containing 
the exact solution some future user is looking for could be very 
difficult to find.

I found this to be the case with the name ion, without the '3' it's a 
very bad filter, and since people often drop the '3' in discussions 
about it, with the 3 it's a very bad filter.

well, Notion Ink != notion, I'd be more worried about "Notion" (the
"music composition and performance computer program", whatever that is),
although, as i said, a lot of software share the same name, and it's
_usually_ OK, especially when they do very different things and/or run
on very different platforms (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midori)

How did you searched for original ion(1)? I did it by:
  ion window manager
and got expected result. Or more often I put into google:
  ion window manager documentation
Did you ever tried to search the word "ion", or "ion howto"?

And my vote:

lion +1 - Lithium Ion, is third element in periodic table and the fork
          will be ion3plus based.

?(nion) +1

Hi all,

sorry for being late for the vote, I'd vote for "nion" and "notion".

With an existing "Notion" software, there's a small chance in having
problems and a big chance not being googlable, and THAT is a bigger
problem IMNSHO, just as panman wrote. We can probably solve it by
using the name "NotionWM" instead of just "Notion".

>> I'm not particularly good with coming up with names. ThinWM?
>> TinyParticle? TilingMadeSimple? Quirk? (Told you I was terrible.)

If we're going to find new names, I'm no better, but the Wikipedia
"ion" page is great for finding metaphors:

* Aurora - sounds like a new, beautiful and exciting stuff
  Competing on Google is the concept plane.

* NucleusWM - sounds nice and would carry the idea of a small WM,
  but there are many other uses for this word, even in software.

* Faraday - he discovered and named the ions.
  There are a lot of fun metaphors we can find ^^

* Polyatomic - well, that's geeky :)


Just my 2 cents,

This calculation in, it would be quite close to the North Pole.

Need to understand if most people will subscribe to the list then the
community will be agree in integral with this name, due to natural
inertia of group of people.  And.. who made you chief?

sorry, i misunderstood this part (well, not entirely my fault really),
my argument is this, with every minute we spend here, discussing inane
matters that will likely never be resolved anyway, we're losing
momentum, as people don't feel like something is getting done/we're
moving fast enough. also, the more we risk Tuomo pulling another one on
us and finally putting the mailinglist to sleep, leaving us out in the
cold, without a way to regroup or reestablish contact.


this of course, does not solve the problem of "natural inertia of group
of people", but it's a way to overcome it, and deal with it at our own
base, later.

We see it once again!

The failure of FOSS!

The failure of IT!

NOBODY, almost NOBODY, is actually interested in making stuff NOT suck.

NOBODY is interested in the long-term.

All interest lies in short-term satisfaction.

All interest lies in simply making shit run on an ever growing pile of shit.

We see the ENGINEER at work.

We see the BUREAUCRAT at work.

We see them shake hands with the MARKETDROID and the POLITICIAN.

They will provide the chrome polish.

Did we perhaps forget somebody?

I am.
Most guys on this ML are, they even acknowledge that "not sucking"
greatly varies for each.
Wrong place to preach.

Well, Tuomo has a far greater troll-power and writing talent.
Sorry, fake Tuomo.

I've been using ion for a long time, I've searched for all sorts of 
things related to ion. ion+window+manager is, as I say, useful to find 
formal ion documentation, or the website, etc. It is not useful for 
searching for informal posts or blogs. People aren't generally that 
specific.
