ER&gt; What is a 'regular configuration file'? INI syntax? resolv.conf syntax?
ER&gt; xorg.conf syntax? xml? What 'standard' configuration files do users deal
ER&gt; with at this point? (Or really ever?)

Excellent question :)

Unix users expect readable configurations without code.  sendmail.cf is
horrible.  /etc/passwd is nice.  /etc/hosts is beautifully simple.

The exact format depends on the purpose.  Configuring X resources is
very different from configuring host names.  So there's no single
&quot;perfect&quot; format, although I personally like YAML because it's flexible
enough to handle any reasonable data structure.

ER&gt; And I should point out that lua can handle 'standard':

ER&gt;     variable = value
ER&gt;     variable = value

ER&gt; syntax just fine. So you wouldn't even need to know it was lua in
ER&gt; the simple case.

That would be great!  Unfortunately it's not the case today...

ER&gt; I think you seriously overestimate the appeal of something like ion3 with
ER&gt; the sort of people who would need such a simplified config file
ER&gt; syntax.

Maybe I do.  I personally know 2 people that liked my tiling Ion3 setup
that were turned off by the Lua configurations.  That's a small sample
size for sure.  But I have written an article on Ion3 for IBM
developerWorks and the main complaint I got from readers was about the
configuration syntax (8 e-mails).

ER&gt; And I might very well consider attempting a simplified syntax parsing
ER&gt; script. Though seeing as how I have been comfortably using the lua
ER&gt; configuration stuff for a long time now I am not at all sure I am going to
ER&gt; be able to come up with useful 'names' for things people want to do.

Cool, I'll be glad to help any way I can.

Ted
