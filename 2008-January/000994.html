<PRE>Hi,

A nice feature of ion2 was that a lot of key combinations that were  
usually ion's keybindings were actually passed to an app when it was in  
fullscreen mode. A handy product of this was that I could open a vnc  
client to another box running ion and still have enough keys passed  
through to the viewer to be able to control the remote ion session.

ion3 intercepts all the keybindings when in full screen mode, meaning I  
can't do this. So, I was wondering if it's possible to have a key or set  
up an xprop or similar that would allow me to disable the host's ion3's  
bindings while I need to use them for that specific application.

Another example where this would be useful would be in applications like  
Xara Xtreme (a vector graphics program), which has F-key bindings for a  
lot of the tools.

I understand the best solution would be to use a program that let me  
configure its keybindings so that they don't conflict, or to have  
different keybindings set in ion3, but I'd rather not do either if that's  
avoidable.

Thanks,

Nick
