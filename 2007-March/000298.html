</I>
that starts to develop in a &quot;I'll have the last word&quot; exchange (well I try to :-)):

if you markup the posted example with latex, 
the content vs. markup ratio would not be better, but worse. if you really
start to write a paragraph, that will be simple continous and perfectly readable
text in the source file, be it in groff, be it in latex. arguing groff vs.
latex is like battling whether emacs or vi is better (I know, you'd say they
suck both and one should use joe). everything I've heard against 'groff -ms' in
this exchange is a matter-of taste decision against it using arguments which
would be equally suited to propose dumping manpages written in -man.

&gt;<i> pairs of characters, even the flow breaks all the time with the commands
</I>&gt;<i> starting a new line.
</I>
come on: &quot;unintelligible pairs of characters&quot; in contrast to ion3 keyboard
shortcuts which lend themselves immediately to memorizing???  I'd estimate that
I continously use about 10-20 ion3 keybindings and probably fewer `-ms' names.
I still manage to handle that...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looking at the documentation as a prerequisite of generating a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sensible document: would you say that is different from latex???
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A sensible LaTeX document can be edited to a large extend without

</I>
correct for you because you know latex. the other way round for me because I
know groff. what kind of criterion is that?  and this trails off: latex would
not be an option here, I'd say, if we want to maintain formattting into the
terminal. that tex/latex altogether is the more powerful formatter than groff:
yeah, could be, but that's irrelevant in the present context (and usually becomes
only notable with the better support of table-of-content, auto-generated
indexes, auto-generated dynamic running headers/footers and such). I would
say the central question presently is: how can I get both, optimal terminal
output _and_ professional publication quality pdf (plus html, maybe).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concerning &quot;understanding&quot; the latex source: I will give you that latex markup
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is much more verbose (which I don't like: I have to type it or make lots of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vi shortcuts or what else) and therefore one could easier guess that
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not that verbose: You don't write the longer commands that often,
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph separation is an empty line, etc. You also don't have to
</I>
you could do that in groff the same way.

&gt;<i> break the flow all the time unlike with *roff. (Yeah, there's also 
</I>&gt;<i> some inline syntax at least in -man, but it's quite awful HT/XML-like 
</I>&gt;<i> begin/end tag stuff.)
</I>
beauty is in the eye of the beholder... 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, the original idea indeed was that of an _interactive_ tutorial.
</I>
I'd rather get a mutt-like _comprehensive_ user manual which contrary to the
above idea would stay useful even for the permanent ion3-user. the kind of
really basic interactive tutorial, which seems to be more the intent as I now
see, probably will be used (and be useful) only at the very first day of using ion3.
that's a waste of effort in my view.

so, please stay at least  with 'man/ groff -man' (but why that in contrast
to `groff -ms' is tolerable remains obscure to me), don't use non-standard third
party stuff which would create additional dependencies.

if you still answer this, the last word in this matter is yours. promise. :-)
