in itself a fair excuse for not supporting it, but not a good reason to  
tell anyone with more than one monitor that they're stupid.

Actually I have had my current pair of monitors for 5 years - the pair I  
had before that are now in use at church office (pastor and secretary),  
having now had a useful life of around 10 years and counting*. My graphics  
card is about 7 years old, the rest of the machine ~4 I think (with no  
immediate plans to upgrade)

I don't think I count as a &quot;techno-toy fetishist&quot;, just someone who can  
see more than the &lt;1 steradian occupied by a single screen at a sensible  
distance in front of me**.

* Actually as I had one of them for a couple of years before the other  
that's proably an aggregate of 11 years - I used my old 14&quot;CRT with the  
shiny 17&quot; CRT for a good while - the 14&quot; screen still finds itself stuck  
in my loft for occasional use.

** Have you read the &quot;anti-mac&quot; interface article  
(<A HREF="http://acm.org/cacm/AUG96/antimac.htm">http://acm.org/cacm/AUG96/antimac.htm</A>) - basically decrying WIMP  
interfaces as a regression in terms of limiting us to pointing and  
grunting at things we can see.  I feel the same about having to wear  
blinkers when I'm working, why did I bother with eyes that can see a  
decent space in front of me?
