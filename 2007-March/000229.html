... I am not going to waste my breath supporting it. Recent
research, BTW, suggests that the manufacturing of a computer
with a monitor, takes five times as much energy as the 
manufacturing of a car. And it is well-known that the 
manufacturing of a car takes much more energy (but not with
quite as high a factor as the above) than a car uses in its
lifetime -- which also isn't a small number. So, there,
you techno-toy fetists chasing after the latest cool gizmo
and upgrading your hardware every few months: your lifestyle
may not last long.

&gt;<i> I don't want to support month old releases therefore:
</I>
... Distributors should not provide them to people as &quot;ion3&quot;
(without further version specifiers) without a very noticeabled
mention that they are unsupported, ancient, and not representative
of the project's present state.

&gt;<i> I don't want to to subscribe to a mailing list...
</I>
... because it's such a hassle to subscribe for just a single question.
I use slrn/NNTP/Gmane for most of my lists, BTW, and have disabled 
receiving the emails. I'd prefer not having to subscribe either, or
the subscription (and disabling of receiving mail) being queried
in response to a posting when not subscribed. (gmane, in fact, does
already try to verify that you really are there and not just a rooted
spam bot, before it lets you post... but the lists don't know that.)
It would also be great to be able to subscribe to just the single
thread that you start -- automatically.

&gt;<i> The less users, the better. Users are a problem...
</I>&gt;<i>  - They are also the point of software - without them software is useless.
</I>
One user is enough. I don't need the zillion kids for whom Ion is the
latest shiny gadget to be dumped when the next one comes along.

&gt;<i> Don't get me worng I still think ion is a great WM, but you seem to have a  
</I>&gt;<i> very odd mental block with regard to people.
</I>
People suck.
