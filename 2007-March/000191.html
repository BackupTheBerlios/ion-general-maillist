I guess I have ended up somewhere quite different from where we started,
yes.  I moved away from your idea of a flat namespace for tags mainly
because I don't think it'll scale well.  I did a &quot;find -type f&quot; in
my home directory and went through giving tags to all the files and
surprisingly quickly started hitting places where files would get the
same set of tags or I would have to give files unnecessary tags to make
naming work.  The tags also started to get increasingly byzantine names
as I worked my way down the hierarchy and I can't see any way for this
not to happen.

I think those are the main reasons that I adopted a hierarchy for the
tags.  Once I'd got them I pulled all the features back I could from our
previous discussions and ended up at the idea I sent.

The main point of departure from your system, as far as I can tell, is
that I only use a single binding (tag,name) is used to identify a file
where as you only want the set of tags to identify a file.  You try much
harder to make the existing Unix interface with the system, but I don't
think this difference is as important.

The main reason I use a single tag, rather than a file's complete set of
tags, is because a file's tags will change over time (I think) yet in
the face of this change we want file names to remain working.

&gt;<i> (How else do you provide persistent search results? That's a key
</I>&gt;<i> component in my system: persistency of locations. Adding new files
</I>&gt;<i> does not stop a known path from working for opening a particular file.)
</I>
I view search results as just that, the result of a search.  Searching
again at a later date *will* return different results and I don't think
it's sensible to try too hard to make it too stable.  If a file can be
located through just one tag I think naming will be much more tolerant
to change.

&gt;<i> Or otherwise you're just unnecessarily distinguishing that file name.
</I>&gt;<i> In doesn't seem like what I'm after at all.
</I>
The file name does become special for me, but I couldn't see any other
way to keep the other properties.


I don't know if I've moved too far away from your idea for the
differences to be reconciled, I hope I haven't and we can bring things
back together again.
