And much more broken too. And I really don't have much use for
a bulky laptop.

The only good laptop keyboard I have met, was on a 8086 &quot;suitcase
computer&quot;. For the kind of device I'm really after, I actually think
that an integrated keyboard should be dropped. The device would 
normally be used by its touch screen when mobile. It could, however, 
be docked to a keyboard with full-sized keys with full range.

(But not a full-sized keyboard. Modern keyboards are way too bulky,
and getting bulkier with the multimedia shit. The numpad -- which 
makes the right-handed mouse even more painful than it has to be -- 
can be dropped straight off. The cursor keys etc. can also be 
compacted as has been done on some keyboards.)

...

Having read some new information about the OLPC screen, it's worse
than I expected. The monochrome mode is OK, but the colour mode is
an awful blurred hack, because it doesn't have proper pixels: colour
is essentially created by diffracting the backlight into a diagonal
rainbow spectrum, and shutting it off with the monochrome pixels [1].
I probably couldn't stand it (unless the resolution was much higher
than even that in the OLPC). Still, at least it tries to use little
power etc. I'm still waiting for the dual-mode e-paper/colour display...
or the fast colour e-paper display.
