<PRE>Apologies Tuomo, I've sent the same reply directly to you as well.
I guess there's no form of nesting in this mailing list.

If no one wants to read my long email, go straight to the gist of it  
below.

Tuomo hates it. I guess I failed.
Bear with me while I attempt one last time.

Actually I think I explained poorly in some areas, sorry.
I was suggesting, after you click on the tab, the menu STAYS up. Click  
on option of choice, then menu disappear OR clicking elsewhere  
(because you changed your mind you don't wanna click anything from the  
menu), then menu disappear also. But you guys already got that right?  
Anyway...

I'm only suggesting an 'optional' feature where I can just stick one  
line into cfg_ioncore.lua :

mclick(&quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/ion-general">Button3 at tab</A>&quot;, &quot;mod_menu.pmenu(_, _sub, 'ctxmenu')&quot;),

It already looks to me like it's already possible and easy to do, but  
I wouldn't know really.

It would be a big plus for trackpad users like me, and it would not  
negatively affect other pointing devices, and it is only an optional  
feature. Everything can stay the same on default.

Think of it this way, ion3 encourages use of the keyboard. The  
trackpad is closer to the keyboard than the mouse.  It is much more  
convenient and closer to reach for the trackpad from the keyboard (as  
you can just use your thumbs while your fingers stay on the keyboard  
area) than reaching for the mouse. The usability of the trackpad  
should be higher priority than the mouse.

I try to see it your way and the way I understand it is, it takes 2  
mouse events, to execute the option from the menu.
1. Press and hold (menu popup, choose option)

(May be 'hold' can be counted as a 2nd event? or more? because the  
event is ongoing)

2. Release             (option chosen, menu disappear)

Whereas my way, it takes 4 mouse events.
1. Press
2. Release (menu popup)
3. Press      (choose option or press elsewhere)
4. Release (option chosen or release elsewhere, menu disappear)

If it's measured by mouse events, then yes the default way is 2 times  
more efficient if you ignore to define how many events 'hold' is  
counted as.

If you look at the effort the finger as to put in, my way is lazier  
(therefore better i say).
Because your way makes the finger hold down the button, it requires  
continuous effort for a period of time.

Especially so for trackpad users, cos in addition to using one finger  
to navigate, I have to use my thumb to  press down the physical  
trackpad right button and have my thumb stay there, while my finger  
chooses an option from the menu.

Or I can double tap hold, and have my finger stick to the touchpad as  
I choose the option, but my height of the touchpad isn't that large,  
so it would suck if I am in the middle of dragging my finger down the  
touchpad and reached the end, and have not reached down to the option  
that I wanted from the menu. I let go, and the menu is gone. Wasted  
seconds.

Now I've spent too much time talking about mouse/trackpad usage and it  
seems like im diluting the main focus of ion3 which is to be keyboard  
oriented. For me, the keyboard functionality is pretty near perfect  
and I can't think of anything to improve on it. The only ONE  
improvement I can think of is on the trackpad/mouse side (more the  
trackpad side) with the menus.

Anyway right,

---------------------THE GIST OF IT IS:-------------------
I just wanna do this:
mclick(&quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/ion-general">Button3 at tab</A>&quot;, &quot;mod_menu.pmenu(_, _sub, 'ctxmenu')&quot;),

As an optional thing.
If possible.

Thank you for taking the time to read,
I don't think I got anymore to add,
Robin
