</I>
The benefit of a wiki is to collect pointers to postings to the ML,  
suggestions picked up during some IRC, or personal experiences, as well as  
adding to the FAQ - leaving this work to the community can lift away some  
workload from you: but might add the additionl supervising/clean-up task -  
which, of course, could be distributed among some core ion users or  
volunteers. However, I wouldn't count on their steadyness and dedication  
much more than those that made their servers available for wikis in the  
past...

&gt;<i> There's, however, the &quot;poor man's wiki&quot; option left: put
</I>&gt;<i> the darcs repository of the home page available on the Web,
</I>&gt;<i> and send contributions by email (with 'darcs send'),
</I>
This could be a nice approach to also tackle somehow the spam issue: there  
aren't *that* many spammers out there that have a darcs repo set up *and*  
a proper MTA setup... Speaking of which: you ask people to send in patches  
via darcs, but occasionally some contributors don't manage to get their  
configuration right. There aren't that many external contributions, but  
how often do you have to take over those patches sent in via some other  
way? That might give a rough indication on a possible (in)success rate of  
the &quot;poor man's wiki&quot; approach.
