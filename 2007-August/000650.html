I think it will be difficult to specify which objects button presses work on, it
would be hard to have submaps and define menus and so on with a simple variable =
setting scheme. As you said... the exact format depends on the purpose.

But the configuration files aren't that hard really, they're well documented, both
in the manual and in the files themselves. They are very easy to edit by basically
anyone who understands variable=setting, because this is what they are. They're
hardly code, they're just function calls. And can easily be edited by just reading
the comments and bdoc and then deciding to which button you want to have that
feature, and then edit that to the button you want. You don't even have to understand
lua or ion or code at all.

And anyway, Lua was *designed* to be embedded in ways like this. That's also the
reason alot of games use Lua for scripting and configuration.  If you know just a
litle bit of lua and a litle bit ion you can really make ion much better then just
the defaults by making small scripts/functions that do stuff. And the reason for
this is that you can bind any lua (or even C) function you write to a key thanks
to the easy-to-use-but-powerful-config files.  Taking this away would take alot
of fun from ion.

ps. maybe the real problem is people in online articles claiming lua is complicated
and difficult -or even needed to understand- and so scaring new users :P
