<PRE>&gt;<i> The laptop I have is a 486/25MHz/8MB with battery live

</I>&gt;<i> more -- a lot -- though.) And the newer laptops also
</I>&gt;<i> aren't good enough to bother with either. Too Fucking
</I>&gt;<i> Expensive, Fragile And Battery-Hungry or Too Fucking
</I>&gt;<i> Bulky To Be Considered Even A Laptop, Let Alone A Mobile
</I>&gt;<i> Computer (which few laptops are). The OLPC is probably
</I>&gt;<i> the best laptop out there, supposing the screen really
</I>&gt;<i> works in low-power mode too...

And people do talk of British humor ... (Finnish one is
much better.)

Okay, but this is for the lucky ones in Kokkola or
Lappeenranta! (I never have been in Finland, and I am
Swiss, by the way.)

Here where I live (West Sumatra) the temperature on
the day is around 30 C [and 25 on the night ... at sea
level]. The air humidity goes up till 80% and beyond
[evening/night or raining seasons], which makes 30, even
25 C feel like 40 in Zurich, Lugano, or Helsinki,

And if it's the *right* day, you may see 5-6-7 power
outages [varying from 5 seconds to 1-2-3-... hours; 20
hours has been the longest, single interval last month].

Ditto for Jakarta, Medan or Pekanbaru (though not that
many times a day). Even in industrial Shanghai/China,
slightly aside from here, it should not be much, much
better [power outages] in general.

I own an S73 series BenQ JoyBook, which I like VERY, VERY
much, I recommend you, and is KICK ASS for the buck [the
display is GORGEOUS by the way ... BenQ oblige]. (&quot;Too
Fucking Expensive,&quot; are you thinking at Lenovo, Toshiba or
Compaq? Agreed then.)

I use encrypted swap, so I can't suspend the mP, I just
step the mP down [ I could suspend it actually, but I
am not interested in that--I would need a non volatile
key--and there are more cons than pros eventually from my
perspective].

Nor I do spin down the hard disk--for reasons.

You may thankfully understand that given people with
a notebook are glad if they can monitor two-three
ACPI-things, not just because it makes fun or is gaga.


Cheers,


/Roy
