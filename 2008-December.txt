Message-ID: <20081211091452.GK83602@obspm.fr>

Hi all,

I'm using....sorry...a old version of ion. 

I've a problem, I don't knwon if it's come from my old version or it's
because my config is not complete.

My version of ION is 3rc-20070927 on FreeBSD.

My problem is with rdesktop :

	Sometime I need rdesktop to connect on a windows server. 
	After rdesktop is launch I can not use the short-key to change
	workplace (only the workplace where run rdesktop). I need to click 
	on the top of the workplace, after that i can use short-key. 

of course that's not big problem. But if you can tell me how can I fix it.

Thanks for your help ? 

Regards.

JAS

Someone tell me the solution (thanks to him).

In fact it's rdesktop to grab the keyboard.

So to avoid this problem :

	rdesktop -K instead rdesktop

I haven't fully committed to Ion yet, but it always annoyed me that 
rdesktop did this. It was surprisingly easy to add a keyboard shortcut to 
get rdesktop to release the keyboard. The attached patch is against 
rdesktop-1.6.0.

I chose Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Enter as the key to perform the "un-grab". (Mainly 
because it's very unlikely I'd ever use that in Windows, but also because 
there was already a shortcut for Ctrl+Alt+Enter.)

Best,
Ben

Subject: Toggle horizontal/vertical maximize behaviour
Message-ID: <494687D8.40909@noo.ru>

Hi there,

I'm trying to switch to ion3 from ion2 now due to distro upgrade.
(Actually, I'm happy with ion2 for now, but can't compile it under
Ubuntu 8.10.) There's a problem which can be reproduced in stable ion3
(from 0install feed).

I'm always have some sort of auxiliary frames which are typically
minimized when i work in main frame. From time to time I need to restore
their size into e.g. 1/4 of the screen, do to something with them and
minimize them again. In ion2 it was done by ALT+K-V either in the main
frame (which de-maximized it) or in the auxiliary frame (which
de-minimized it). It is generally works in ion3 too. However, sometimes
auxiliary frames get minimized to zero height and stop reacting on any
resize commands. (E.g. I see only tab heading, but if I switch to that
heading and try to do ALT+K-V or even ALT+R-N, there's no reaction.) The
only way to unshrink it is to resize main frame.

Is it a bug or a feature? :)

For some reason, Alt+R Mod1+N does work, although it's the
move binding.

I may look into this more closely next year; now I have
other things to concentrate on.

Works for me.

However, http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/repos/ion-scripts-3/
may be faster; at least darcs1 used to handle redirects
stupidly.

Without second change key binding don't work.

Why guard _sub:WClientWin was added?
_sub seems to be nil in most cases, when this key bind checked.

I've been frustrated by this as well. I haven't yet been able to determine under
what conditions a minimized frame "forgets" its maximized height/width, only
that it happens occasionally.

I'll be happy when Tuomo finds time to look into this :)

Ok, attached is a patch that might help with the issue, also
available from the darcs repository. Please let me know if it
helps, so I can finally make the new maintenance release that's
been pending (getting through with PhD defence busyness).
