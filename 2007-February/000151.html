That's what I intend. At the file system level, there's no ordering
as such: files are addressed by sets of tags, and this set is enforced
to be unique for each file. The programs (or a FUSE plugin, for getdir) 
can then do some ordering for nicer listings. 

As for the implementation, yes it shouldn't be too complicated. 
My present plan is that each tag has a sparse bitmap associated 
with it, with the bit for each object ID that has that tag set, set
to one. Then you just 'and' these bitmaps when you search for the
subset of files having the given tags set. This should be quite
efficient given a suitable sparse structure for the bitmaps. 
However, pruning the results (there can be a lot of them), may
demand a bit more effort. But it should not be a problem in a Riot
scale application. Note that these tag-based bitmaps could be 'and'ed
with further filters, such as a date one, that do not, however, 
constitute a part of the file name, unlike the tags. 

There's, however, another structure needed for looking up a particular
file with exactly given set of tags. One approach would be to use a 
binary self-balancing tree (red-black, AVL), but I'm afraid that could
be too inefficient on a file system, as multiple 'inodes' all around the
disk would have to be accessed on each lookup. An alternative, possibly
more efficient, approach would be to order the identifier sets by tag ID,
and use a nested B-tree for looking up the files as if they were on a 
normal hierachical file system. In fact, you could store the files on 
a normal underlying file system in that hierarchy. I do not plan to do
so, however, although I do intend to use (at least initially) a normal
FS for storing the files, with an additional file for the indices.

I have not looked in detail into how LFS (Logic File System) does this,
and maybe I could in fact use it, but the last I checked, it was gone,
and the first time I checked, I couldn't build it.
