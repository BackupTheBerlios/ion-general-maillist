if  you  say  so... maybe right w.r.t. dependencies on libs.
otherwise:

I  tried it again with yesterday's version and I should have
known better: trying to compile ion3 &quot;manually&quot; under MacOSX
is  a  nightmare  for  anybody  not  up  to his waist in the
internals of gcc and differences introduced by apple.

is  there  *anbody*  out  there  able  to  compile  it under
macos???

I gave up (again...). problems (to the extent that they have
surfaced) are related to several gcc/ld flags not  available
under MacOS:

-shared
-whole-archive
-export-dynamic

and  librt:  is  that  supposedly  a  standard lib? it's not
there.

tuomo,  man, get a hold of yourself (or, rather, the licence
text), so that it is again sufficient that _one_ guy  solves
it  _once_  and  puts in back in the repository. it can't be
that much fun to see users suffer. or can it? I,  at  least,
am fed up with trying. that's no longer a manageble average-
user task.

and,  of  course,  if  in  the  end it were possible to find
makefiles and/or system.mk  versions  on  your  side,  it'll
help.  but  I'm  at  least  obviously  not  in a position to
contribute  these  for  MacOSX.  (and  it  only   seems   an
unnecessary  complication  in comparison to having it in the
repositories. but I suspect your attitude is uncorrectable.)
