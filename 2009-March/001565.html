The reason for symlinking is a marginal startup performance improvement :).

Actually, the styles menu does write dopath code in the session directory
look.lua, so maybe that should be done in the initial setup too.

</I>
Probably fixed by adding if(frame-&gt;brush!=NULL) test in frame_clear_shape.

I can't currently properly push these patches in the repository, as
I have yet to set up cygwin properly. The default &quot;cygwin&quot; darcs is
100% broken -- it's not a real cygwin build, but a super-dirty hack
that simply uses cygwin to build a native program, as is the case
with ghc -- and does not properly work with cygwin.

(Yes, I got a &quot;new&quot; computer, and at the moment it seems that it really
is Goodbye Linux! Incidentally, the biggest troubles with the Windows
(XP) switch are again that FOSS -- Cygwin -- is crap, slow, and doesn't 
even properly support multibyte encodings. Linux, well, it may be ready 
for the desktop, but it isn't ready for the laptop by a long stretch. 
But maybe I'll write something in the non-blog about it. Though I have 
to remark that the Trackpoint simply rocks.)

-- 
In 1995, Linux was almost a bicycle; an alternative way of live to the
Windows petrol beasts that had to be taken to the dealer for service.
By 2008, Linux has bloated into a gas-guzzler, and local vendors and
artisans have had to yield to &quot;all under one roof&quot; big box hypermarkets.
