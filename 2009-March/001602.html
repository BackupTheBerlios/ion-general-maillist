Well, yes, but the situation is almost the same on PCs: all the 
affordable models have a glossy screen.. and typically crappy 
keyboards. And the nipple you find only on the el cheapo Thinkpad
SL models. The better T-model Thinkpads are just as expensive
as Macbook Pros in .fi but come with a shallowscreen and megabezels
these days. (The Thinkpads tend to be about 500e cheaper in .de 
compared to .fi!)

Would have to try for an extended period to find out if they'd
have managed to make it work tolerably, but so far I've always had
to disable to trackpad to be able to use a laptop.

Sure you can run Ion in X in OS X? I run it in Windows XP under
Cygwin/X, and half of my apps/windows there. (In Xterm, but
also plan to use gv/xpdf/xdvi for TeXing when it comes time 
to write something again.) It works comfortably enough, switching
between Windows and Ion, after I changed Mod1+Tab to Mod1+Q
in Ion, instead of passing -keyhook to X, which disables the
Windows key too, which I'd like to work (could then Win+tab
on the taskbar). This keeps the Windows window-count tolerable;
it couldn't handle the gazillion terminals comfortably without 
a tabbing terminal emulator or something... but that's just Ion
then; I consider it my &quot;IDE&quot;.

&gt;<i> You may find yourself disappointed at their quite-non-standard
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard layout 
</I>
I have to reconfigure the keyboard on any system I plan to actually
use for anything, in any case. Done that on Windows too. (Caps lock = 
control, extra altgr between shift and z, extra altgr+key bindings [1].
No dead keys, they suck.)

In 1995, Linux was almost a bicycle; an alternative way of live to the
Windows petrol beasts that had to be taken to the dealer for service.
By 2008, Linux has bloated into a gas-guzzler, and the cycle paths 
have been replaced with polluted motorways.
