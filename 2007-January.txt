Subject: workspace name
Message-ID: <20070104153849.GA7711@pcjas.obspm.fr>

Hi all 


I am a very happy user of the ion3 window manager since ion. Thank's for the
great work.

I've recently update my ion3 and I've read in the README the WSFloat have
disapear. OK Right.

Now when I need something like WSFloat I'm using context-menu (MOD+M) and
type new-empty-workspace. But I don't know how I can give a name for this new
workspace. Or in case that's not the good way to create sometime like
WSFloat workspace, how can I do ?

Other question : How can I modify the generic workspace configuration
(create by F9) ?

Last question : I've read 

https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/ion-general/2006-November/001468.html

but this lua script don't work I've got ??? in statusbar.


I'm using 

	ion-3ds-20061223

Regards

Yeah, it isn't there anymore for workspaces without the default layout.
I wonder what would be the best way to go about this...

See cfg_tiling.lua for how the default is set. (You could define an
alternative somewhere else. At the end of cfg_ion.lua, for example.)

Lots of thanks.

I find a way to do exactly what I want.

I've modify the cfg_tiling.lua just like you say ...and I change 

	bottom_last_close = true,

to

	bottom_last_close = false,

And now I can create a workspace (using F9) with a name, destroy the tiling
frame and I got a floating workspace with a name 

Regards.

Subject: Statusbar and colors
Message-ID: <459F98C7.90905@elfenbeinturm.cc>

Hello,
I'm new to ion and I really like it (using ion3-3ds). Most things work 
like I wanted them to work, but I'm just missing a few things (I hope 
these questions haven't been answered before, I searched the website and 
didn't found an answer)

- Is it possible to restore a frame layout for a given application with 
more than one window (e.g. gimp) or have I always have to move the 
windows into the appropriate frame (Gimp Main Icon Bar into a small left 
frame, Layers into a small right frame, Image into a big center frame)? 
I already created a workspace with the desired frame layout, but I would 
like that gimp automagically fills the frames when started.
- Is it possible to use colors in the status bar (e.g. a label in blue 
and the value in white or separators in gray)
- Is it possible to turn of some of Ions key bindings only for a given 
application (e.g. midnight commander)?

Thanks in advance

Alex

You can assign identifiable windows to certain frames with winprops;
RTFM for details. You can't presently automatically create a workspace
of given layout etc.

> - Is it possible to use colors in the status bar (e.g. a label in blue 
> and the value in white or separators in gray)

In a very complex manner, yes. By modifying all the monitors to specify
monitorname_hint to have value the appropriate substyle from the stdisp
style, and setting this style to have the appropriate colour, you can
get all the monitors to be display in any colour they want. Perhaps
there should be a way to specify a style to use in the template, or
perhaps the meter name should be included in the substyle used for the
meter. However, there _will not_ be a way to specify colours directly: 
that is against the philosophy behind Ion's drawing engines.

By awful script hacks, yes. (Check the switch_bindings script from the
repository.) No, there will not be cleaner support for such disgusting
features.

Yes, but somebody could fill less lines showing you how to do it.
The key is to look for window names, binding the respective 'regexp' with
actual Ion frames. the procedure is indeed in the Ion help pages.

> Is it possible to use colors in the status bar (e.g. a label in blue 
> and the value in white or separators in gray)
Yes, you could change colors editing the module lookcommon_*.lua, depending
on the theme actually used.

> Is it possible to turn of some of Ions key bindings only for a given 
> application (e.g. midnight commander)?
Very possible, you don't need to change anything to achieve your goal.
On Linux systems the META key is usually left-ALT.
press META + K + Q to bind the next command to another program.
Example: META + K + Q  =>  F10  to exit from "mc".

Alternatively you could bind some special commands like this (note: the module
used is 'ioncore', the ioncore's function used is: "exec_on"):

    bdoc("SLEEP"),
    kpress("XF86Sleep", "ioncore.exec_on(_, 'xset dpms force off')")

(Put to sleep your monitor).

Bye.

Subject: ion3 with dynamic twinview
Message-ID: <45A37CCE.7050007@gocept.com>

Hi,

I've discovered NVidia's dynamic twinview feature last week. It allows 
me to add and remove displays from my twinview configuration at runtime 
without restarting the xorg server.

However, Ion (and gnome) don't get it right, when I add a new display. 
It extends the existing single workspace over both displays instead of 
making to separate workspaces (or virtual displays, whatever the right 
term is). When I startup with both displays connected and let twinview 
figure out the initial configuration, Ion gets it right and gives me two 
screens.

Christian

Ion does not support runtime changes in display configuration, and 
_won't_ get it "right" even over restarts if the displays are shuffled
around a lot. I have no plans of writing that support. Xinerama sucks
anyway, being incompatible with every other extension, and multihead 
in general is a fucking waste (of energy etc.) most of the time too.

I'm sad to hear that (both that the situation seems so tiresome and that 
  ion won't get the support), but I appreciate the effort you take in ion.

Thanks for your quick answer,

Actually, with waste of energy I was referring to energy consumption,
this non-winter we're having, etc. But, yeah, multihead support in
general is also a waste of my personal energy.

:) I agree that multihead is something that is rarely needed with ion, 
but I do enjoy having a separate screen to hold some information that I 
want to 'passively' monitor while working on my main screen ...

Message-ID: <20070109185354.GD1993@abridgegame.org>

Hi all,

I have an annoying problem, which is caused by something in my
configuration, since it goes away if I rename my .ion3 directory to
something else and restart ion3.  The problem is that when I close a
transient window, the frame that it opened in stays behind.  I am sure I
could track this down by some sort of a binary search, but am hopefully
that someone could point me in the right direction as to what sort of a
configuration might cause this.  Any ideas?

I'm running the ion3 which is in debian etch, which is version
3ds-20061029.

I think something like the Optimus Mini3 keyboard could be very handy.
It has Linux drivers (including Perl bindings) and I've been meaning
to write some code to integrate resource monitoring with it.  The key
is that it's separate from X, so it would work with a server and with
a workstation the same way, you don't need even one monitor.

Yes, thanks, that fixes it! So presumably the fix would be to figure out if
the windows are transient, and avoid modifying them if that's the
case... (not that I have much time to look into it either...)

Having extraneous tabs, for now, is definitely better than suffering this
particular bug!

This error looks like a problem in your locale setting.  What is your
locale, ie. what is your $LANG environment variable?  Maybe setting an
encoding there fixes the issue (eg., for me LANG=en_US.UTF-8)?

Hi,

Running ion 3 20061223-1 from Debian, I get a strange behavior:

ioncore.goto_next(_, 'right') actually goes to the left,
ioncore.goto_next(_, 'left')  actually goes to the right,
ioncore.goto_next(_, 'below)  actually goes to the above,
ioncore.goto_next(_, 'above') actually goes to the below.

Did I do something wrong, is this expected, or is this a bug?

Thanks,

Subject: fliping focus problem
Message-ID: <45ACD84B.2040205@collax.com>

Hi,

i hope this is not too much of a FAQ.

Since a while my ion3 startet fliping the window focus from one screen
to another. This happened not too much but was verry anoying.
After upgrading my debian box (unstable) this problem increased
dramaticly and now occures regulary.

ion3 version 3ds-20061223
Debian package version 20061223-1


First i discovered that the window focus was not allways under the mouse
(horribly anoying). Now with increased regularity i discoverd some cases
how to reproduce the effect.
It seeems as it allways happens when a windos pops up or the window with
the focus gets closed. Instead of focusing the next window under the
mouse, the focus flips to the next screen (dualhead setup).

This drives me up the wall!
I would be glad if i could do anything about this.


Thank you

Oh, well that is it. I did not realise that my default X setting has
xinerama on.
I disabled xinerama, and the problem is gone. Thank you so fare...

But i really miss beeing able to move windows from one screen to another.
Or let me put it this way, i really liked my 17" penis enlargement. :)

Seeing the FAQ, your standpoint on this topic seems verry clear although.
Maybe it needs someone that ignorant as you to make such a great and
radical WM like ion. ;-)

Thank you for your work - with little mixed feelings.

Not exactly the same, but related: if I have focus on DISPLAY :0.1 and  
there is some activity on some other workspace on :0.1, I use M-k k to  
switch there. But when I M-k k to switch *back* to where I was, it moves  
me to :0.0.

Subject: Xinerama support
Message-ID: <slrneqsrvn.27a.tuomov@jolt.modeemi.cs.tut.fi>


The totally bitrotted Xinerama support has now been completely removed. 
I got annoyed by certain hacks used to make it work, because they made
the _normal_ case over-complicated, and so turned the dummy WRootWin
structure into a WScreen, and in the process the bitrot of Xinerama
support for final and complete. And I won't waste time fixing it.

However, it is possible to re-implement that support as a separate
module, that should do the following things:

   - Create new WScreen objects within the root window WScreen
     for each Xinerama screen (mplex_do_attach_new with suitable
     geometries and size policies).

   - Set the screen id of the root window (WScreen::id) to less
     than zero for the layout saving and loading code to ignore
     it. 

   - Number the Xinerama WScreens from 0 upwards

   - Possibly remove bindmaps from the WRootWin, or use other
     ones, so that they don't overlap with those of the nested
     WScreens.

Note that this new setup inadvertently provides for the 
possibility of having both workspaces/windows spanning multiple
Xinerama screens and single ones. Someone will just have to
waste time writing and maintaining the module. That someone isn't 
me.

The mod_xrandr modules provides a suitable skeleton for this
module, and indeed, as Xrandr support is a separate module,
it is also fitting for another mutually incompatible, ugly 
and broken extension to also be a separate module.

Message-ID: <slrneqv9r5.u7l.tuomov@jolt.modeemi.cs.tut.fi>

I should perhaps add that even with a mod_xinerama and _any_
reasonable effort, Xinerama will still have serious problems, at
least with programs that try to position their own floating windows,
and possibly also ones that use crappy methods to look up windows.
The former simply is not doable without updates to the ICCCM to be
aware of nested WM window configurations. Currently the ICCCM does
not specify how applications should handle multiple levels of WM
windows, but also does not disallow it. So one app handles that one
way, and another the other way. 

It is not reasonable to not have the confusing "virtual root windows"
for each physical screen if you want the workspaces on each screen to
be separate for floating windows, the windows that this problem
mostly affects. And if you don't want them to be separate, you don't
really need Xinerama support. Configurations with screens of totally
differing sizes appearing as one are absolutely stupid (but so is
multihead in general, most of the time). Hence, Xinerama is a mostly
useless piece of crap of an extension. You either don't really need 
the information, or you'd simply want plain old X multihead with window
migration between screens, something that is only _artificially_ 
restricted when the bit depths are the same. 

But the general trend among the X folks is to write crappy mutually
incompatible extensions for everything, instead of extending the X
protocols. (There's _no_ need for Xrender, Xft and that shit. It
would've been sufficient to add extra transparency and blurring bits
for programs to set when they can cope with that stuff, and use the
old stuff.)

I suspected it might not work anymore, but didn't get around to
updating it yet. But, infact, it _does_ work! You just have
recompile it, of course, as the structures it needs to access,
have changed.

I don't know enough about X to fully understand your mail.

In my setup I do have a laptop and an external LCD with a different
resolution when I am in the office.  I currently fold my applications
from the monitor to the laptop screen when I leave the office.

Are you saying I do not need Xinerama to achieve this or are you
saying that I need to implement that module if I ever want to upgrade
ion?

Thanks,

Ulrich

-- Screen		"Screen0"
-- Screen		"Screen1" LeftOf "Screen0"

function go_home ()
   local right_screen = ioncore.find_screen_id(0)

As far I'm concerned, I also have a laptop and an external LCD with a
different resolution. I'd thought about a setting like yours but I
finally found out it wasn't really convenient (mainly because I did
not really make use of the laptop monitor). What I do now is simply
cloning the externel LCD to my laptop (thus some parts are not
displayed on the laptop) and when I go home, I just unplug the
externel monitor, use xrandr and restart ion (with ioncore.restart).
It works great.

OK, I have an nvidia card and I use the twinview extension to clone
the external display but I don't think this is actually needed. And
anyway, ion (3ds-20061223) works perfectly fine with it.

Cheers,

     Arnaud

I'm saying that you don't need root windows spanning multiple physical
screens. Plain old X multihead with completely separate screens is
quite sufficient, and better than the ugly big-ass root window hack
of Xinerama. Especially if the migration of sub-windows from one
root window to another wasn't artificially restricted, as it 
presently is. But a single screen is also very sufficient for 99.99% 
of users.

But I cannot move applications from the one head I don't see any more

You are saying it *should* be easy, but it currently is not - right?

So I either stay with the current ion version or implement the module

X doesn't allow "reparenting" windows from one root window to
another. There's no fundamental technical reason why it shouldn't
be possible when both root windows have the same bit depths 
(and hence the same X "Visuals"). There doesn't seem to be
anything in the Xlib API that would prevent that either. Some
X server implementations and Xlib internals might need some
updating, and some crappy programs might also get confused
by allowing this, but issues are not insurmountable, and the
only real reason why it "can't" be done is, is some hallowed
specification saying so.

I agree - I'll also be sticking to the last snapshot with support for
multiple monitors and migrating windows between them (whatever that is
called in X terms) until someone re-adds support. I simply need the
space. It is a pity, but I have no feel for coding graphical
environments (always get my X's and Y's wrong :) so I'll probably be
forced to abandon ion before to long.

I don't really need my windows to span both displays. I'm perfectly fine
with windows being confined entirely on one screen or the other. But
I do like moving windows between the two screens occasionally. (Only
when starting a new application, and it comes up on the 'wrong' display.
Because I can easily move windows, I've never figured out the winprops
support. Would winprops work for the 'standard X multihead'?)

> Or forget multihead. It's stupid anyway.

Sometimes it is more economical to purchase two lower-resolution devices
than one high-resolution device -- at least, that was the case five years
ago when I changed from a 1600x1200 fuzzy CRT to two 1280x1024 LCDs. I
didn't want to give up the screen space, but a 1600x1200 LCD was simply
not in my budget at the time. (I'd even bet money that my two LCDs draw
less power than that crummy old CRT. :)

In any event, thanks for the fine window manager. I hope to be able
to adapt my work habits to fit the new version at some point in the
future. :)

Thanks

You don't need that much space. Your field of vision isn't that big at
a "working distance" (as opposed to "monitoring distance") from the 
screens, so you could just as well switch a workspace as turn your head
to the other display. Like I say in the FAQ, the real reason for 
multihead is penis enlargment most of the time.

> (I'd even bet money that my two LCDs draw

Yes. My 17" TFT is supposed to draw 33W "typically" (whatefer that means), 
while CRTs can easily draw 100W and more.  But TFTs may very well pollute 
and waste energy more during their manufacturing. (There's the issue with 
dead pixels, and hence scrap panels for one thing. Any real statistics on
the proportion of rejected panels?)

What we're doing (well, what I'm doing, most of the time) is no
different to having something printed out for reference while I'm
working.

In some cases the reference is some sane reflowable format, so there'd
be no difficulty in fitting everything on one (normal-sized) screen.
But often, it's PDF, which (I find, anyway) doesn't fit readably on a
1280x1024 screen concurrently with an editor.  Same seems true of
quite a bit of web-based documentation.

So I use two monitors.  Alternatives would be a bigger screen, and
that would work fine, I expect.  Obviously printing things out, though
it's handy to have searchable things, and I routinely refer to quite a
lot of material.  Or switching between workspaces, of course.  It's
just that much more convenient just to have another monitor.

A friend of mine uses two monitor to have at the same time her emacs
and a high definition preview of her documents when LaTeXing her
articles (she rotates one of her monitors to have a Portrait preview
of the page). As far as I'm concerned, I prefer splitting my screen in
half. I don't know whether we can talk about penis enlargement for her
;) but, although there is definitely some show off in this setting, I
can understand it might be convenient.

Actually, it's not so much about the size of the screen. I don't find
19" 4:3 offers anything over 17" 4:3 at the same resolution, or even
a slightly bigger resolution (e.g. 1600x1200 vs. 1280x1024... which would
be more of an enhancement on a 17" screen than between 19" and 17", but not
much of enhancement in either case, as both resolutions are still so poor). 
It's more about the shape. There's horizontally a bit of space left in 
the field of vision after a 4:3 screen, that a widescreen display should
fill. You can comfortably fit two A4 papers on a widescreen display, 
wasting less resources than multihead, that normally will have a lot 
of screen space outside your field of vision.

And should I remind of the floating splits of Ion? I also mostly just
split the screen in half horizontally (Mod1+K S), and then float the
halves (Mod1+M, float...) for e.g. the browser that unfortunately needs
so much space on crappy Web pages, and for workspaces with LaTeX work.

That's true, but you do not have to search for the workspace. You can
put the apps you often have to look at (debugger/browser/manuals) on
one screen and your "working area" at the other one and do not have to
type in or cycle through app names ...

Maybe so, but we could use gnome too, couldn't we. Is just not
convenient enough ...

One question: How do you debug ion ? One tft two xservers ?

Not sure whether that's how Tuomo does it, but that sounds like a job

Although there are some programs that are _so_ broken that this is an
advantage.
VNCviewer, for instance, jumps to steal focus (any time the remote
changes size, as it does when you're watching a development machine boot
up), unless it's on a multihead display, in which case it sticks to one
screen (I think it's screen 1 in my setup).

Not that that's any excuse, I really ought to try and fix vnc myself...

John

PS - Have to say I disagree about multihead being a waste of time, even
after reading Tuomo's "Not a blog" entry. I find the additional screen
real estate very useful, and much cheaper to manufacture/buy/run than a
40+" screen ;)

I disagree - I can easily fill my pair of 1280*1024 monitors with active
 frames, the overhead of moving my eyeballs slightly is a whole lot less
than flicking backwards and forwards between workspaces - especially on
older hardware*, which takes a while to paint the screen.

The other advantage is that it's an infinitely flexible document holder
by your workspace - so the document I'm referencing and my workspace, as
well as the results of my code changes can all be displayed comfortably
and easily - alongside the few windows I actively monitor, sat at the
far edge of the screens.

Jumping applications between the screens is a very useful thing to be
ale to do as well, especially if a colleague comes to see what you're
doing, I'd like to be able to move workspaces in their entirety, but
that's evidently not happening any time soon.

John

* My monitors are about 5 years old, and PC about 4.  It doesn't always
crawl, but it does take appreciable time to change workspaces.

Xnest is crap. Firstly, it's buggy and crashes all the time, or causes
programs not to work. Secondly, bindings will overlap, and Xnest can't
go into a grabbed mode where it would receive all the key presses, as
far as I know. VmWare would work better than Xnest! But two servers 
on one TFT is what I use. How'd you even do anything like that with
two servers on separate screens? Two keyboards and mice? What an 
unusable hack.

Umm.. I just have the documentation and such stuff on one side of the
screen, and the code on the other. Works great. One project per
workspace. 

Debugger? What's that? fprintf is my debugger! (For the occasional
'gdb backtrace' I usually just use the same xterm running the editor, 
^Z:ing back to the shell. The same I use for compiles. Although there
would be space for a small compilation/debugging terminal/frame on the
documentation side of the screen, I've never got used to switching
there. ^Z works reat.)

Sure, by "size" I really mean in pixels.  I'm constrained by company
policy to use TFTs (we decided that for reasons which probably aren't
so valid any more, so possibly I could argue against that), so that
limits my choices.  I'm disappointed I can't get the same kind of
resolution on a desktop screen that is available on laptops, but I
imagine the costs (environmental and other) even out (physically
bigger screens probably don't cost much more than smaller ones; it
probably depends more on the number of pixels).

Quite true, although I'm not so confident about the relative costs.

Certainly I don't feel that much advantage in having two screens---a
single one with a similar number of pixels would do just as well
(especially with ion).  I guess if ion regards my existing two screens
as one big one that won't be too bad; it would be slightly annoying on
the occasions where I want to make some application full-screen,
though.

Yeah, I'd suspect so. It probably isn't easy to produce displays with lots
of tiny pixels, and there are bound to be more defects. Infact, I wonder 
if we'll go back to analogue tech, one day. If it would be possible to 
produce thin pixel-less displays somehow, working like plotters. I don't
know how you'd do that, and it might not work for non-vector graphics, 
such as moving video, but... it's an interesting prospect anyway. Maybe 
nano-machines arranging themselves in instructed shapes... :) (Infact,
the E-paper techs I am aware of are quite "mechanical", and I wonder if 
you could control the ink balls floating freely instead of suspended 
in pixels...)


> Quite true, although I'm not so confident about the relative costs.

Well, there's the issue of bigger displays probably having more rejects,
but the widescreen display is about least half smaller than a second
display, there isn't a second PSU with its lossess and costs, less
casing, and so on.

It's truly amazing what you can fit into one monitor, isn't?

One monitor
   Multiple virtual consoles (ick!)
     Multiple workspaces per console
       Multiple frames per workspace
         Multiple tabs with xterms per frame
           Multiple screens per xterm
             Multiple vims per screen
               Multiple tabs per vim
                 Multiple windows per vim tab

Who could possibly need one more "multiple" at the top of that tower? ;)

-Steve (happy with one!)

Physically it'll be significantly smaller, but I'd guess the physical
stuff (glass, plastic, PSU, etc.) aren't significant compared to the
cost of the TFT.

But I'm guessing.  I wouldn't want to argue that nobody should choose
a widescreen monitor rather than two squarer ones.  Or a good quality
CRT.  All seem defensible choices, depending on what you have already,
what space you have, whether you're worried about heat.

(One of our concerns at work was heat from CRTs (perhaps bizarrely,
given that we're in south west London, but we really had been in an
office where heat was a significant problem, though we aren't, now).)

I quite like having my malleable content on one screen and my reference
content on the other screen. This makes it far easier for me to monitor
email and IRC (on the left display) while reading reference content (on
the right display). Swapping workspaces requires erasing the reference
content when bringing up the malleable content.

This constant erasing and replacing content works against my innate
ability to remember where content is on a page. When I had a single
1600x1200 display, I could fit reference content and malleable content
on screen quite nicely. But it was fuzzy. So I tried 1280x1024 LCD and
found myself swapping content enough that it detracted from my ability to
get work done. So I bought a second LCD and have enjoyed the extra space.

Perhaps I've waited long enough to treat myself to a new display with all
the space I need. :) (Pity my video card can't do more than 1280x1024
DVI output. I _really_ don't want to be in the market for a new video
card too. Blech.)

> Like I say in the FAQ, the real reason for

Perhaps. But some of us find it more useful for reading reference matieral
while working on other stuff than advertising our qualities as mates. :)

Honestly, expect better from your users. :)

The argument for not supporting Xinerama that I can easily appreciate is
what it does to your code. Saying "just don't use it" isn't nearly as
compelling as "it fuglifies the code".

[And speaking of heat and power consumption, the state of software
suspend in Linux totally sucks, and yet it's one of the most important
features I can think of. It sucks having to leave the computer
on when you don't use it, because it's such a _chore_ to bring it 
and all the programs up again, especially as session management support
sucks too (and there's no protocol it for terminal programs). The 
hardware suspend support of desktop mobos also tends to be poor, PSU fan
still keeping humming and so on. (And I haven't heard of that good
things of the Linux laptop support either.) That's one very good reason
to use Windows: hibernate. Of course, even better would be if the computer
could run on _really_ low power, shutting down all the fans, not using 
the disks except very infrequently, and so on, but still react to ssh 
connection attempts etc. ...). Well, at least with 'athcool' I managed
to make the system run 10C cooler most of the time.]

Umm... why do you need to check on IRC an Email all the time? Perhaps
not being able to concentrate on the work at hand is your problem?

Nah, there's no too long time. I used my previous dislay (17" CRT)
for about 7 years until it died, having been in its dying spasms
for year (kicking and hitting helps with dying hardware!), and then got

If my job required more dedicated programming, absolutely. In fact,
when I do the bulk of my programming, I bring my laptop to a location
without network access and program free of distractions. (I rarely need
references while programming beyond 'man' in the scratchpad, so the

Ugh. Yes, you -can- work in that environment, but that doesn't make it

Depends what you're doing, of course.  Often I'm working with ITU
standards (X.511, etc.), and I have those in PDF.  For that matter,
quite a few API docs seem to be in annoying frames-requiring HTML,
which don't really squash that well.

Depends on how the member state has implemented the EU directive, of
course.  And how that law's interpreted by courts and companies.  In
the UK I believe the intention is that the Distance Selling
Regulations provide a similar experience to consumers for things
they've bought at a distance to what they'd get in a shop.

Specifically, if we buy over the web we can't (necessarily) see the
physical box, read what it's got on it, etc.

I believe the law here's usually interpreted (by vendors, anyway) such
that if you actually open the box (and, even worse, plug the device
in), then you can no longer use the DSR to return it.

And the legislation only applies to consumers, not business purchases.

Yeah, I'm waiting for the flexible, printed, high-resolution display.

In the meantime using two relatively cheap TFTs seems reasonable.
There's lots of experience producing them, so presumably there's less
wastage than with less common varieties (unusually high resolution,
maybe even widescreen, though I guess widescreen ones are common
enough now).

Here, AFAIK, you're supposed to be able to inspect the product just 
like you could in a shop, and to do that, you need to plug it in.
Basically the returned product has to be in a shape that it can still
be sold as new.

> In the meantime using two relatively cheap TFTs seems reasonable.

A single TFT is more reasonable, unless you _really_ need the space,
(i.e. can justify your need to me and other critics). Most don't, 
least of all for their home setups. (I suppose Seth here may have
a proper need, if he _has to_ _monitor_ the _content_ -- and not 
just  something in general happening -- of an IRC discussion 
constantly (modulo the product being supported being of any positive
value), while doing something else. A rather small screen should 
suffice for that, though, e.g. that of a laptop if the computer 
itself was the laptop.)

The difference of course being, that in a shop you can't inspect
that _particular_ item you get, but the display article. And being
able to inspect the one you get is the crux of getting a TFT without
dead pixels.

Don't know wether my first posting got through or not, so I'll just
repost ...

After the lengthy xinerama discussion here I got to think about how I
use ion. As as consequence I find myself using float-splits more and
more often; now I wonder: 

Is it possible to have the float, that has no keyboard input expanded
(don't know if there is an "official" other word for it) ? i.e. see my
opera window in full size but type in my partly hidden emacs ? 

Thanks!

No. It wouldn't be a lot of work to add a function that momentarily
lowers a frame: there's the generic rqorder function, that's just
missing an implementation on WTilings. However, the stacking order
would likely be reset the moment anything else is done on the layout.
Just switching the workspace could reset it, if an stdisp is used. 
To maintain the layout, the architecture should be changed considerably
again, and I don't want to do anything of the sort in relation to Ion3
anymore. Just finish it quickly, work on other things, and get back
to Ion in the form of Ion4 in a few decades :) or so.

I've actually been thinking, that a fish-eye view of the presently
partially hidden window, might be nice. Especially if the program
could provide a focus point itself, so that things under the cursor
are not much distorted, but they get more distorted towards the 
edges (that often contain unimportant controls etc.). This kind
of things, of course, demand the use of XComposite or such...
*sigh*, another mostly undocumented X API to learn... which will
probably delay the work on Ion4 for yet another decade, as a lot
of ideas I am starting to have for Ion4 almost depend on it.

Actually, that's not completely true. It should infact doable by adding
a new bit in the split structures, and then doing some work maintaining
it in the split tree (and that should be the most of the work). 
Essentially this amounts to duplicating the 'current' pointer that's
presently used to decide what's on top, and much of the code related
to it.

However, there's another problem: pointer focus. Lowering the present
frame could well put the cursor in the other frame, and thus give it
the focus. (Infact, this _will_ happen on the right-hand side of
a split, if the pointer has been warped to its default location,
and also on the left from this same location.) It should be possible
to kludge around this, but I hate working on anything related to
focus changes, and especially when the change is caused by the
pointer changing windows.

I'll have to wait till ion4 then ... which, when xcomposite will be
supported, opens up a lot of possibilities ...
Any plan, when you'll begin with it ?

Message-ID: <20070126034745.GA22812@jurjenm.stack.nl>

Hello! First off, thanks for making ion! it's great!

Something seems to be wrong with the query/ autocompletion part of
manpages (F1).  I can use F1 and then type the name (or other man commands)
and then i get a pager etc, but if i accidentally press tab no autocompletion
comes up, but alot of sed-processes get made and my computer gets very
slow!  they also don't seem to end (?) but killall sed fixes it.  I
couldn't find much info on what happens, but either pointers on where
to find more info or how to completely disable autocompletion for this
query would be cool!

I also have a litle question about scripting ion... how do i make a litle
script that opens a new workspace and sets up the correct windows (with
names for use with winprops) and then load the correct program? I read
some other mails on the list and found someone asking almost the same
question asking maybe he could use ioncore.read_safefile(). And he got
a reply he could use WMplex.attach() to set up his workspace (?). But
since the function-documentation is sometimes a bit cryptic i have a few
questions :)

- I think the best way to try at this is to use the lua-code command
  (mod+f3).  I can type in litle commands i know from the key-bindings
  i have, but i'm not sure how to use the WMPlex.attach function and
  usually get weird-ish errors if i try something. so where can i find
  some examples using read_safefile and/or attach?
- this is a bit stupid but how would i print the table returned by
  ioncore.readfile().  I tried something like this
  print(ioncore.readfile('saved_layout.lua')) but this just prints :
  'table: <adress>' and i don't know enough lua (yet!) to know how to
  work work with that :)

greets! jurjen

No tab press is needed by default. Also, there's no "auto-completion".
Auto-completion where the first completion is inserted on the query
line. I doesn't do that: I don't like it. The default behaviour is
"auto-show completions", where the list of completions is generated
automatically, but nothing is done beyond that. It is possible to
configure Ion to use the old "tab completion" model too.

You know, there's a reason for the note on caching in the README.
Not that it takes _that_ long on my system without it, but too 
long to be comfortable. In any case, you want to experiment with
ion-completeman (in $SHAREDIR).

> I also have a litle question about scripting ion... 

'man grep'. Also check the scripts repository.

No i ment WEdln.complete() (which is bind to tab). What is the old
tab-completion model?

It would be cool if i could get ion to do shell-like tab completion instead
of the next match. I'm not sure if ion can already do this but i couldn't
find such an option. i'm not a very good programmer, but i had a (very)
quick look at wedln.c but am not to sure what everything does, but still
reading it...  Some more questions :)
- Is there some more documention on (or in) the ion code somewhere besides
  the listing of classes in the ion manual? Starting at the functions that
  are exported to Lua is good, but it is a litle annoying that there is
  no (?) comments in the code about how ion does things..  But maybe i'm
  just looking in the wrong place as usual :)
- the completions are in the edln->compl_list thing? I got to complete.c
  via wedln_do_set_completions() which calls edln_do_completions() and
  there is a function get_common_part_rmdup() which seems to do part of
  the kind of tab-completion i want. I think the code i want to make will
  be easier (for me) because i don't (?) have to call wedln_next_completion
  (or _prev_) but just can make a litle function that looks at what is in
  the query-box so far, gets the 'context' of the query (?) and then prints
  the biggest common part of all the possible completions and updates the
  autoshowcompletion-box thing. I'm sorry if i sound a bit fuzzy :) i
  haven't got a clear picture (yet- i hope) of how everything hangs together.
  Anyway, if someone can help me get some insight on what the variables
  in the structure (/class) Edln, WEdln and WListing mean or a litle
  description of how the code for auto-completion is structured i would
  really appreciate that!
- edln is the non-visual part and the edit-line and Wedln is the other way
  around right?

hehe you're right :)

- anyway, i think ioncore.create_ws(_,my_ws_params,true) will do what i
  want, but is _ for the first parameter the current WScreen (also known
  as the right option)?
- Is there a way to make Ion obey the maximum window size hints (WM_SIZE_HINTS)
  throug winprops so they only work for some programs?  I cannot make
  windows smaller then the application wants, but i can make the window
  bigger which sometimes is annoying because some programs stay at 1 size

The usual tab-completion model: Hit tab. If there's only one completion,
it is substituted into the query line. If there are multiple, they're
displayed, and only the common part substituted into the query line.
You can get this with mod_query.set{autoshowcompl=false}. (Well, could
-- apparently there's a segfault problem in the present release.)

No. It should all be self-evident :).

Maybe. Probably.

Yep, Edln is the low-level line editor in no way tied to the UI, whereas
WEdln is the the Ion query line UI to it. I had to write Edln, because
all the other line editors available (libreadline and was it editline?)
seem tied to the TTY with no abstraction away from it. (Plus libreadline
sucks for being GPL.)

Depends on where the call is. In the default configruation, it IIRC is in 
the WScreen bindings, so yes.

Maybe. Maybe there is already a suitable winprops. RTFM.

Subject: upgrade problems
Message-ID: <20070126224158.GA23250@a5.repetae.net>

Hello,

I have just upgraded ion and I'm trying to figure out what I need to
change about my configuration files to get it to start functioning
properly again.

The version is 3ds-20061223. 

When I start it, I see the following errors:

>> Unable to find 'mod_ionws' on search path.
>> Unable to find 'mod_floatws' on search path.
>> Unable to find 'mod_panews' on search path.
Warning: Input Method Open Failed

Also, there are no tabs at the top of the screen, each window I open
seems to be in full-screen mode. However, when I create a new
workspace, the windows are floating. This was not the behavior prior
to upgrading.

Thank you,

Frederik

It would be nice if you could in any case post them to the list as well -  
so others will have an easier way to find the answers (and they do not  
have to be repeated once again on IRC).

Thanks,

Summary: "mod_ionws has been renamed to mod_tiling"
"Maybe one or two keybindings need fixing as well."

22:19 < _frederik_> hello, i've upgraded ion and now it isn't working again
22:19 < _frederik_> do i have to change something about my configuration?
22:19 < _frederik_> version is 3ds-20061223

22:50 < urs> _frederik_: what version did you upgrade from? pre-october?
22:57 < waawaamilk> _frederik_: what happens if you create a new workspace? do things work there?
23:07 < _frederik_> urs: yes, certainly
23:07 < _frederik_> waawaamilk: if i create a new workspace, it comes up floating
23:11 < waawaamilk> can you not get a query for one?
23:11 < _frederik_> query?
23:11 < waawaamilk> F9
23:11 < urs> _frederik_: the most important config-change from pre-december versions is that mod_ionws has been renamed to
             mod_tiling
23:12 < _frederik_> urs: oh
23:12 < _frederik_> urs: perhaps that's the issue
23:12 < urs> So you'll need to fix that in your config
23:12 < urs> Maybe one or two keybindings need fixing as well.
23:12 < _frederik_> why are there so many incompatible changes?
23:12 < urs> Because the internal architecture has been overhauled an (imho) beautified.
23:13 < _frederik_> sure, but renaming things isn't important enough to be a reason to break compatibility
23:13 < urs> The new code doesn't differentiate between tiling and frame workspaces anymore, you can mix them freely.
23:13 < urs> Well, ion has always been a development playground. If you want stability, stick with ion2. :)

Here's a description of the changes I made, using the above hints:

Also, I had to change .ion3/cfg_bindings.lua, inserting the following
blocks (taken from the new /etc/X11/ion3/cfg_bindings.lua) and
removing the corresponding bindings from their old locations:

----------------------------------------------------------------

})
----------------------------------------------------------------

I thought autoshowcompl had something to do with the box that showed all
the possible completions, not the kind of completion. It doesn't segfault
on my computer though (i386 freebsd, ion 20061223).

I found an old thread on the mailing list about how to do this, and you
said there it would be easy to export region_get_configuration(). I made
a litle script with it and it works nicely i just have a few problems with
how mod_query.query() works (see below).

i couldn't find one, but i haven't tried them all yet :) 


Here is the litle script i made to test loading and saving workspaces, i
can load workspaces as much as i want but i can't seem to get the
query-completer function to work. Any tips on that?

tester={}
local workspaces = ioncore.read_savefile('saved_workspaces') or {}

-- bind this function to a button with WGroupWS context to save the current
-- ws
function tester.save_ws(r)
   ws_def = r:get_configuration(r)
   ws_def["switchto"] = true
   ws_def["bottom_last_close"] = true
   workspaces[ ws_def["name"] ] = ws_def
   ioncore.write_savefile('saved_workspaces', workspaces)
end

function tester.query_load_ws(mplex)
   mod_query.query(mplex, "Load workspace:", "", tester.get_ws, 
                   mod_query.make_completor(complete_saved_ws), "load_ws")
end

local function complete_saved_ws(s)
   ws_list = {}
   for i,d in pairs(workspaces) do
      table.insert(ws_list, i)
   end
   return mod_query.complete_name(s, ws_list)
end

function tester.get_ws(mplex, ws_name)
   WMPlex.attach_new(mplex:screen_of(), workspaces[ws_name])
end

you have to add something like EXTL_EXPORT_AS(WRegion)  above the function
region_get_configuration in ioncore/saveload.c and then rebuild ion, but
when that's done, it works pretty good! i'm happy now :)

I'm almost done with my lay-out load and safe script, i think it's getting
pretty nice so i'll post it here :) If you have any comments on what i can
improve in it i'd like to hear them, i'm pretty new to ion (scripting) and
very new to lua, so all advice is welcome!

also printing a table (with ioncore.write_savefile) i get with functions 
like region_list and such all give an error message "failed
to initialize userdata" so i'm not sure on how to use these functions. How
do i examine the data these functions give back?

anyway, here it is! hope someone finds it easier to use then the other
session-save scripts out there (i do :)

--   script that produces a menu to manage workspace lay-outs. it uses
--   an unexported C-function Export it by typing "EXTL_EXPORT_AS(WRegion,
--   get_configuration)" above the function region_get_configuration in

I was looking through things in Ion-3 and noticed the usage of some
structures that could be implemented using existing structures in Lua,
one of the seemingly important elements of the WM.
 1) stringstore
   This could take advantage Lua's string storage.  Perhaps using a
table in the registry w/ a known index (ex: name).  Using a the
LUA_ENVIRONINDEX would be useful, however from the look of it, this
may not work.
 2) other rv_tree usage/map/ptrlist/
  Lua's table structures could be a useful place to put the RB-trees.
In writing this email and researching more into the code, it looks
like the tree structure is used alot... so there could potentially be
vast improvement, or a vast amt of wasted code-writing.

However... if the direction of Ion is to use more Lua integration,
changing the mechanisms could be another step in immersion.

1)
Pros:
 * Any strings shared between Lua/Ion indirectly would use the same
memory space.  The current Lua implementation prevents duplicate
strings and even simple ptr comparison would prove data equality
(however the Lua developers state that this is an implementation
detail and should not be treated as 'standard' behavior).
Cons:
 * More work...
 * Potentially less performant (I have not run benchmarks on Lua's
tables vs the rb_trees... but I do know that the table implementation
has been an object of optimization due to its importance)

2)
Pros:
 * Mapping values would be simple
 * Any lists/trees/maps exported to Lua may be usable as-is (if object
setup is done at add-time, such as linking metatables to objects).
Cons:
 * Looks like plenty of work:
   * The iteration functions would need to be converted to Lua-based ones:
      * Mappings -> using 'next'
      * Arrays/Lists -> using array-like indexing (however 1-based)
 * Long lists would have array-like performance behavior if order is
important, otherwise you could do a mapping like
t[(lightweight)ptrOfValue] = value, depending on the type of object in
the list.  Strings could just use t[string] = string.

Any other ideas on this?
....  I just started using Ion-3 a few months ago due to its Lua
integration (great fan and user of) and then found the tiling
behavior, responsiveness, and lightness to top out the Lua integration
as a factor.

I'm a bit divided on taking so much advantage of Lua, and keeping the
core of Ion rather ignorant to the extension language used.

Yeah, I've thought about this...

> Perhaps using a  table in the registry w/ a known index (ex: name).  

That's slow. The C-side references are already indices into the registry.
You could simply directly use the registry, just like the ExtlTab and ExtlFn
references use, but there is a tiny problem: you'd still need to do your 
own reference counting. The ExtlTab and ExtlFn reference IDs are duplicated
for each C-side reference, and so can not be compared. And being able
to compare the strings with simple integer equality is crucial of
stringstore. Lua also does so, by comparing the object pointers, but
these are not available to user C code from the basic API -- and for
a reason: the garbage collector doesn't know of client C code references.
So you'd have to do the comparison as well through the Lua API, and that
has a _lot_ of overhead. Especially as thanks to the extensive use of 
longjmp by Lua, I have to wrap everything in lua_pcall...

So it seems, that for stringstore Lua integration is not an option,
at least not with the present API.

>  2) other rv_tree usage/map/ptrlist/

I actually used to use Lua tables for some uses of the red black trees,
before I added the code to libtu. But then I needed a more efficient
implementation for something (or maybe it was because working with
tables or Objs alone is cumbersome, and I didn't want to extend libextl 
to support arbitrary userdata). And once the code is there, it's better
to use it.

just use right hardware ;) for example, hibernate and suspend to ram
works fine on thinkpads.

Does it also spin down the couple of external hds? (Because the laptop 
surely isn't going to have enough disks pace.) How about the box 
providing a decent sound card? (I've yet to see a tolerable integrated
chip that didn't completely distort the sound.)

Laptops make quite lousy and expensive tabletop computers, what with
an unnecessary screen and keyboard. (The foldable 17" computers aren't
that good either. No, they're not laptops. More like dragtops.) Laptop
keyboards are crap, just like tapping the table. And with the extra 
keyboard on the way, the screen becomes unusable as well (in addition 
to being already otherwise rather tiny for tabletop usage -- and too 
big to be mobile, really [1]).

If someone is interested, I know what was wrong.  I have /usr as
a symlink to another location and /usr/lib cannot be symlinked in
any way.  I had similar problems with compiling something else
and using `mount --bind' instead of a symlink resolved it.

I found about this on gentoo bugzilla:

If it wasn't working on my laptop then I wouldn't of started using Linux 
on my laptop. Luckily for me suspend2 works well on my laptops.
