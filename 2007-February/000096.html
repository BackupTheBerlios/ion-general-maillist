<PRE>
The past attempts at an Ion wiki set up by various people,
have not been huge successes: they've quickly degenerated
into awful mishmashes. Therefore I will not be linking to
any future attempts: they will fail anyway. The big problem
with such a separate wiki seems to be, that there's no
maintainer to clean up random edits with little regard for
decent layout and style. I personally don't like working
through a Web form for bigger edits, so a normal Wiki is
also no option for a site that I would maintain. I am also
no fan of the usual over-complicated Wiki markup syntaxes.

But do we need a &quot;community editable&quot; site for Ion? I am
not so sure. There is some demand occasionally, but the
amount of contributions to the past wikis has not been that
huge. Nevertheless, every contributed FAQ entry and such
would ease my workload.

As is known, the Ion home page is actually presently
generated by ikiwiki, which can be used through various
version control systems, not necessitating the use of
inferior Web UIs. It would therefore, in theory, be
possible to turn it into a proper wiki. However, that would
demand servers that I can easily run the software I want on
(which is not presently the case). But, you know what, I
rather maintain the FAQ than a (virtual) server to
maintain...  and pay for it. Servers contributed by random
people are too unreliable.

There's, however, the &quot;poor man's wiki&quot; option left: put
the darcs repository of the home page available on the Web,
and send contributions by email (with 'darcs send'), and
manually apply/moderate them, just like is done with the
scripts repository presently. Enabling that would demand me
to add kludges to my synchronisation scripts (yuck), and
clean up things a bit, so I have not done that yet. (This
would enable turning the scripts repository into an ikiwiki
site as well, with scripts indices generated by a suitable
plugin from descriptions in the source files.) And I won't
do that if there isn't any interest in contributing to such
a non-wiki. Is there?
