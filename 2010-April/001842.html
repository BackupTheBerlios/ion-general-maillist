It's a pretty solid guess...

&gt;<i> ion3 has been my primary environment for a while now, and I won't

</I>&gt;<i> towards getting us going right now if needed.
</I>
+1

&gt;<i> We have at least a few tasks to accomplish ASAP just so we don't lose
</I>&gt;<i> continuity or momentum (please suggest other things that need to be done
</I>&gt;<i> too):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - We need a new name and so far, I personally like both &quot;notion&quot; (my top
</I>&gt;<i>    favorite) and &quot;neon&quot;. Do we have any other nominations? Note that we
</I>&gt;<i>    can always change the name later. It's good to get moving on things
</I>&gt;<i>    even based on a temporary name if we can't reach consensus.
</I>
&quot;notion&quot; seems to get the most support amongst those who posted so
far...

&gt;<i> - We need to get the codebase including the latest set of sources (easy,
</I>&gt;<i>    many of us have this), and also as much of the associated git repos as
</I>&gt;<i>    we can.
</I>
done, <A HREF="http://github.com/gwash">http://github.com/gwash</A>

&gt;<i> - We need a central place to get ourselves organized and store code. I
</I>&gt;<i>    nominate sourceforge (well established, well known, supports git).
</I>&gt;<i>    I've speculatively created a new 'notion' project (we can change name,
</I>&gt;<i>    details, or even the site later):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://notion.sourceforge.net/">http://notion.sourceforge.net/</A>
</I>
i was thinking more of googlecode (easier to set-up and get running, and
it has a forum/mailinglist of some sort), but i guess sourceforge is
good too..

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - We need 2 or 3 managers and/or lead devlopers. IMHO, managers do not
</I>&gt;<i>    /necessarily/ need to have in-depth code knowledge, and lead
</I>&gt;<i>    developers do not need to necessarily manage, though this can all be
</I>&gt;<i>    the same person. Any volunteers?
</I>
I agree, and so far we have one volunteer (Alexander Rink, up there),
anyone else?
