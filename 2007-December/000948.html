GPLv3 includes provisions for additional terms that may require modified
versions to be renamed, etc. [1, Section 7, c &amp; e]. Programs covered by 
such additional terms (as listed in Section 7) and GPLv3 remain compatible
with other GPLv3 software (which may also contain additional terms as
listed in Section 7), while those additional terms become viral. 

That's my IANAL reading of it anyway. If to not keep a limited set
of additional terms compatible with GPLv3 codebase, why include such
provisions at all in the license?

Actually GPLv3, does already in Section 5 state that &quot;The work must carry
prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant
date&quot;, which might even be enough, but is up to interpretation. GPLv2
idiotically only required source files to carry notices, but few end
users ever see them.

&gt;<i> Hmm, what would that look like as a package management feature? just
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;new version available&quot; (like synaptic does - if you provided your own
</I>&gt;<i> repository you'd have that now) or do you mean just complaining to the
</I>&gt;<i> end user that &quot;these packages are stale&quot;?
</I>
In the case of distros not keeping up-to-date, just complaining to 
the user trying to install or upgrade a package, that the version 
available is not in sync with author, and author may not support it.
This would be a very useful service for all software, not just for
complying with the Ion license. 

But more generally, of course, a package management system could
automatically keep watch on packages being updated, and notify the
user.
