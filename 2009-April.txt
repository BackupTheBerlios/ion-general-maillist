Hi,

I'm wondering how hard it would be to implement support for having clients
visible in more than one workspace, e.g it could work like the tagging feature
for moving windows, only clients could be attached to several frames and/or
workspaces.

If anyone know of a script with similar features, please let me know.

Regards,

Oskar N

A basic version shouldn't be too difficult. Just a script that attaches 
to one of the hooks that signal workspace change, and then moves the 
window around.

What's more work is remembering where exactly the window was on each
workspace... for that, there's the placeholder mechanism, but it
isn't exported to the Lua side ATM.

Would it not be easier to just duplicate the client to refer to the same X
window? I don't even know if that is possible, but if it is, that's how I'd
prefer to do it.

Ummm... I don't know what you really mean. The client always refers to
the same window it initially created. You can move it around in Ion's
window management hierarchy (cf. Mod1+A, Mod1+T & Mod1+K A, tab drag),
also to follow you around. Obviously you can automate this by attaching
a script to suitable hooks. 

The difficult part is that it would always appear at the same index in
a frame etc.; this demands exporting the placeholders to Lua side.

This would be really nice to have in ion3.  Something I miss from

I'm not sure how X works, but I'm guessing there is some kind of handle that
an Ion client refers to to draw the window. Would it not be possible to
use this same handle in a new Ion client, which would essentially render the
same window?

Excuse my ignorance.

You cannot have the same application actually running in different
frames without application support. At least one problem is that
different frames can have different sizes, and the application will
draw its content based on the size.

With application support, you can do such kind of things (like Emacs
"make new frame" for example), but they will still be two distinct
frames.

What you can do (and what wmii, awesome and other do) is that the
resize the window on-the-fly when the workspace changes. Then the
application redraws the frame at the new place, with its new size.

Fix your locales settings. You need the .encoding (e.g. fi_FI.UTF-8)
part in LC_CTYPE (or LANG), because Xlib is broken.

Hi Deepanjan,
To change the locales setting you need to modify /etc/default/locales
and reboot.
Check the output with locale command.

Message-ID: <slrngts72u.jq4.tuomov@jolt.modeemi.cs.tut.fi>


The X we all knew is dying, and it's being killed by its developers.

As their latest onslaught, the Xorg dickheads have removed 
SaveUnders from X. Expect flicker when dragging tabs or 
moving windows under Ion and a new and rusy X. They want you
to implement and use a heavy memory, cpu, and battery-hungry
composite manager instead... and do not provide a generic 
one worth shit.

They do not follow the original design of X and extend it; 
they gradually replace everything with crap and remove the 
old ways of doing things. Soon on their list will be core
the good old fonts, as they want you to use their blur-fascist
fantasies. It's impossible to keep up with the shit that the 
FOSScracy throws at you, unless you're one of the big 
corporate-sponsored projects that is already part of the FOSScracy.

The lamers even banned me from posting on the list. Censorship, 
silencing the critique. Sure sing of an incompetent tyranny.


It was a good time to switch to Windows. X as we knew it will 
soon no longer be. 


Something to laugh at:

On the same tread, the fuckwits discuss how they need some way
to identify displays for DPI settings etc... after they removed
simple display identification by switching from the good old X
multihead o Xinerama/Xrandr crap.

Propably a stupid question, but:
Do you still work on ion or will you let it die (which would be very
sad, because it's the only window manager I can productively work with)

I don't have the time to really work on it.. and it would all in
any case be wasted keeping up with the degradation of X and other
dependencies. In any case, I'll try to fix bugs (I still have a
cygwin X), although ATM the the VCS switch is still in progress,
and nothing really happening... it's too much pain to convert
a multi-repository project, the usual tools even fail on the
repositories thanks to the windows darcs being just broken...
which generally doesn't work nicely enough with cygwin to keep
using. (And there's no cygwin darcs, because GHC sucks.)

If there's going to be any new development on Ion -- and
it seems doubtful that I'll find the time and energy,
although I'd really like to see my Ion4 ideas implemented
and tested -- it would most likely be in the direction of 
a Windows IDE: not even attempting to be a whole WM for 
Windows, but rather just running some cooperative 
apps/components (e.g. modified cygterm) in a nice
environment. That's how I use it now in any case:
as an "IDE" with xterms in it. It still depends on
X, however, which is something to remove from the loop.

But it's unlikely I'll find the time and energy...
I'd like to already move to the management department
and direct some code slaves. But what's more likely
and happening already, is an army of imitating monkeys,
all doing redundant work and producing shit due to
limited resources.

Message-ID: <20090409200536.GA19882@fl.fami.org>

Hi,

Is it possible to set up the VirtualBox 'seamless mode', where it is
supposed to integrate with the window manager, so that the guest
windows are managed by Ion? Currently if I turn on seamless mode, the
only thing that changes is that the background of the guest desktop is
replaced with the root window of X.

Or is there any other VM software that can do that?

The host is Linux with X.org 1.6 and Ion3, the guest is Windows XP.

Regards,
        Vladimir

Tuomo -- I certainly respect your opinion.  When it comes down to it,
this is your distribution list, and I would not be a part of it if I
did not want to read about your ideas and thoughts.  So, I wish you do
not take offense to anything I am about to say.  I do not want you to
think I am providing anything more than an ignorant view from a
desktop user.

It seems to me, that if this is what "killed" X, than Windows 95 was
the death of Windows.  And if that had not done the trick, Windows ME
and Vista were two pointblank shots to the temple, leaving a rotting
carcass behind.

However, truth be told, I am not one to firmly state one OS is better
than another.  I use both Windows XP and Linux and am quite happy.  I
tend to think far to much energy is spent trying to convince others of
a particular operating system's superiority over another.  I think all
have great features that can be utilized.

But, like I said, having very little in the way of true programming
experience, I am an ignorant, if not blissfully ignorant user.  I just
see irony in you outlying the increase memory use, cpu power, and
battery consumption; my wife's new laptop with Vista is all that, and
more bothersome for me, it is way to colorful.

Oh, no, there's no single one thing that killed X, but all the
recent actions to "modernise" (read: over-complexify) it:

Vista does suck in my experience... in vmware. But I use XP.
Windows 7 sees like in improvement.. based on vmware tests.

You can select a W98-lookalike theme in both Vista and W7,
and as a nice side effect blurring gets disabled.

Does it create managed windows or just override-redirects?
I'd expect the latter, which are likely to then get hidden
under Ion's tiling.

And unlike Linux from 2001 -- which didn't suck quite as much 
as Linux 2009 -- Windows XP is still a widely-used and somewhat
supported operating system that you can actually use and run 
new applications on.

You can manually emulate this by tagging a window with Mod1+T,
switchking workspace, and attaching the window in a frame on the
chosen workspace with Mod1+K A.

It's not difficult to write a basic script to automate this.
I can't find one in the repository, but I'd expect someone
to already have done this...

It seems that all guest window are drawn inside one X window even in
'seamless mode', so probably the latter.

Maybe some other virtual machine is able to create a separate X window
for each window inside the guest OS?

Just use VirtualBox in standard-fullscreen-mode on a separate Workspace.
That's the most acceptable pain.

No, that's Ion-in-cygwin-X-on-windows, after changing Mod1+Tab
to Mod1+Q in Ion. Integrates much better than a fully 
keyboard-grabbing VM... albeit not perfectly :(.

Subject: Questions regarding statusd monitors
Message-ID: <200904150726.06817.jstadermann@gmxpro.de>

Hi,

I'm using ion3 nearly a year by now and I can't imagine ever going 
back to a "normal" wimdow manager. Currently I'm playing around 
with statusd monitors, and I have some questions that probably 
some of you can answer:

Does anybody know of a monitor for the sensors program on linux? 
Currently I use the statusd_exec script and a combination of grep 
and awk to monitor temperatures and fan, but I would rather use a 
lua solution. If not, that's probably a good start to get some lua 
experience.

Does anybody use  statusd_df or statusd_sysmon? I only get '?' as 
value for the meter. Since both scripts use templates, I'm doing 
probably something wrong here, but I handled them the same way as 
other monitors.
Example: statusd_df.lua has the line 

statusd.inform("df", df_str)

so I put %df as meter in my template in cfg_statusbar.lua and 
 
mod_statusbar.launch_statusd{
-- 
--
  df={
     -- some options
  },
--
--
}

Again the result is '?'. Probably the script is broken, but I 
don't know enough lua to tell, therefore it would be interesting 
to know if somebody uses statusd_df or statusd_sysmon. 

I'm using ion-3-20090110 on slackware-current.

TIA
Joerg

No, I have to use sensors to get this info.
