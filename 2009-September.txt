It has come to this. Unless miracles happen, I don't think I will
be using or working on Ion much anymore. Cygwin is a big pile of
shit [1], with an even bigger pile of filth for a project manager; 
It has no hope. A typical FOSS project, that is. I will be trying 
to complete my Windows transition, and reduce my Cygwin dependency, 
hopefully to nil. This will mean that I can not use Ion anymore;
I do not personally have the time for a Windows port.

  [1]: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.os.cygwin/110341

PS. I will need a decent Windows text editor to even attempt
moving out of Cygwin. Any suggestions? I need set-mark
type selection (I don't like shift selection); configurable
key bindings, with support for key sequences (^K B, etc.);
LaTeX syntax highlighting, maybe Lua, etc.

Vim works fine without cygwin on windows and I am sure emacs or its various derivitives have cygwin-less windows ports as well.

Emacs is available for Windows natively 
(http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/), so is VIM 
(ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/pc/).

It's a shame that you are not going to be working on Ion anymore. 
Windows also needs a decent window manager; it's default one is also 
horrible.

I never liked emacs. Joe-bindings are half emacs, half wordstar,
but I just can't stand emacs' own bindings, beyond the basic
de facto standard unix movement bindings. Years ago, I tried 
to start usin emacs, but just couldn't. Too crippled. It's like 
an OS missing the editor. ^X combos are awful hand-twisters,
and it seems ^X is hard-coded (at least in GNU emacs) in many
places, so can't be remapped to something more useful (in joe:
forward word). Another annoyance was, well, Escape Meta Alt
Control Shift, how you needed one binding for search forward,
another for search backward, third for replace forward, and
so on, these not even including a case-sensitivity toggle.
In joe, otoh, the single search function just queries the
options. There were various other annoyances, like the syntax
highlighter not having the concept of numbers, etc. 
So I doubt I'll be going for emacs, if I can find something
else. Joe would be the best, but it doesn't run natively on
Windows. And, since not running in a terminal, something
not contstrained by the text terminal would be nice, for
displaying automatic folds, etc.

Vi, well, it's from such a different world that I don't
dislike it like emacs, but never really ?got it? either.

Didn't stay long on my system... too complicated procedures to

Hell, no, not vi. Vim. You get syntax highlighting, folding, a decent scripting
system (vim 7+), code navigation (ctags), a whole load of great plugins
available and a *sane* interface to move through text. Regarding latex,
latex-vim is a really good environment to edit/compile latex files, complete
labels, quotes, etc.

Thanks very much for Ion.  I've been using it for years and, the way

Yes, I'm sorry if this is a little off-topic, but I too would like to say  
thank you for such a great piece of software.  It's a shame it's ended on  
a sour note with the X devs and such, just a shame really.   I wish you  
all the best of luck in your future work, whatever it may be!

yours, with best regards,
Jerome Jackson.

Me too.  The tiling, the convenient queries, the lua, the statusbar, the fullscreen-anything (all at once), etc etc.  I don't know if Tuomo gets any warm fuzzy feelings from outpourings of gratitude or not, but hopefully he's proud of all he's done for the *nix users that do like efficiency and control of their interface.

I'm using an old version of ion3 (ion-3ds-20060317)
which I compiled from source on Mac OS 10.4 (PPC)
and it works just fine. Haven't tried any newer versions.

To run it satisfactorily, you really need a full screen
X session. I have used both Apple's xquartz and
the xorg that is currently in Fink. I use xorg now.
You will probably need to fiddle with your xmodmap and
your key bindings to get comfortable keyboard
control. I could send you mine but the chances are
the key codes will be different on your computer anyway.
I like to use the 'command' keys as mod1 under ion,
and you can use xev to find out what key codes are
generated by each key.

Running more than one X session appears to be possible
(I've done it by accident) but is probably not a good idea.

Samer.

Why on earth would you say that?

If it works for Samer then there's negligible value in upgrading at
all--it may fix some bugs/introduce new features, but it may also cause
some things to break that were working before.  If ion were something
like a filesystem or a database where it's correctness determined
whether it silently corrupted things then it would be a different
matter.  Upgrading to the latest version of ion only needs to be done
"immediately" if you're actually hitting a bug that may have been fixed
in a later version or you want the functionality provided by the later
version.

AFAIK, this is an early result from economics, the "cost" (in the case
of ion, your time/patience) of change is very rarely zero.  It helps to
explain a lot of behavior we see in the real world.

Yes, my sentiments exactly - thank you. The version I have works
great for me and has no bugs I've come across. Even installing that
over a previous version I had meant I had to make a lot of changes
to my configuration scripts, which was fine and I'm not complaining
at all, but I see no reason to spend more time fussing over a window
manager even if it is the best window manager in the world. On
Debian I upgrade everything regularly because it is almost cost-free
(usually anyway) but I know from experience that compiling 3 years
worth of changes from source (and on Mac OS X) will probably not be.
I could do it - I'm not an idiot - but it's just not worth my time.

I do love ion, honestly :)

Samer.

Yesterday I was angry, today I'm miserable. I'm too much
alone with my thoughts; my anger and misery.

I'm feeling somewhat regretful for such angry words; no
I don't particularly like the guy and his strict discipline, 
but I do not want to be a bitter old man hating and hated 
by everybody, so I'll start by saying sorry here.

Since I probably won't be working on Ion much, and Ion3
seems very stable anyway, here's an updated license file
without the 28-day clause. There's also one patch available
to Ion3 at <http://iki.fi/tuomov/ion/patches.html>, not
included in the latest release.

  If the name Ion(tm) or other names that can be associated with the Ion
  project are used to distribute this software, then:

    - A version that does not significantly differ from one of the
      copyright holder's releases, must be provided by default.

    - Significantly altered versions may be provided only if the user
      explicitly requests for those modifications to be applied, and 
      is prominently notified that the software is no longer considered 
      the standard version, and is not supported by the copyright holder.
      The version string displayed by the program must describe these
      modifications and the "support void" status.

  Versions for which the above conditions are not satisfied, must be
  renamed so that they can not be associated with the Ion project, their
  executables must be given names that do not conflict with the copyright

End of terms.


Explanations

Trademarks: With the terms above primarily appealing to copyright law,
should any of the indicated trademarks be found invalid, does not excuse
you from the conditions imposed by those terms. The use of these names
in contexts other than redistribution of this software and modifications,
is outside the scope of the terms above, and governed by applicable

Significant change: Bug fixes are insignificant as additions. Basic changes
that are needed to install or run the software on a target platform, are 
insignificant. Additionally, basic/small configuration changes to better 
integrate the software with the target platform, without obstructing the
standard behaviour, are insignificant. Everything else is significant,

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must
be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
    performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.


    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
  Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

I thought I wanted this some time ago so I wrote some utility functions
to do it. (attached) It's very crude though. Only for left/right and it
pretty much assumes only one horizontal split I think.

I never really used it much so I haven't bothered to improve it.

As you can see from the code it's pretty trival to do.
(it's only swap_lr and swap that's important)

Maybe the hand-modded patch will work now.

  Thanks, one less restriction.
  I think this is the way to make Ion nicer for developers. In fact I would add just recommendations, instead of restrictions, to a common license.

That's always a wise and humble reaction, and saying it publicly is also very
brave on your part.  I guess most of us sometimes get the feeling that the
world is against us, but you know, every person is a whole world in itself and
getting to understand others' positions or limitations tends to get difficult
and frustrating.  But that's just the human nature!

Anyway, rest assured that many people shares your opinions and greatly values
your work, especially for its boldness, insightfulness and tecnhical quality.
Congratulations and thanks for that, I've been and I'll be using Ion for a very
long time! :)

Thank you!

I actually found out a more general way to do it based on the
"move_current.lua" script that moves a window in current frame to
another frame in a specified direction, only I swap the windows inside
them instead.

Well said. One thing I'd like to add is, Tuomo, thanks for the fantastic
support you've always provided for Ion. It's been dependably quick,
helpful, and insightful, and has made me confidently switch all my
computing environments to use ion.

Hi everybody,

 

Sorry for my bad english, I'm a french people. I've just discovered the

to put a background image to my desktops. I have installed imagemagick
and trried to put an image using the display command :

But it doesn't works. Any idea please ?

I think the "issue" (not really an issue, but a "feature") is that ion
draws a (flat) background for all the frames it uses, and because of
that you can't see your wallpaper (the frame background is on top of
it). Try creating an empty workspace after setting the wallpaper. If you
can see your wallpaper, then all you must do now is to make the frames
transparent, so your wallpaper can be seen in all the desktops. To do
that

  1. locate the "look" theme that ion is using
  2. edit it, adding the following 

		de.defstyle("frame", {
			based_on="*",
			transparent_background = true,
		  }
		)

     put that text after the 'de.defstyle("*", {' section

  3. restart ion.

Hope this helps,

Try creating an empty workspace after setting the wallpaper. If you can see your wallpaper, then all you must do now is to make the frames transparent, so your wallpaper can be seen in all the desktops. To do that

  1. locate the "look" theme that ion is using
  2. edit it, adding the following 

		de.defstyle("frame", {
			based_on="*",
			transparent_background = true,
		  }
		)

     put that text after the 'de.defstyle("*", {' section

  3. restart ion.

Hope this helps,

Subject: On continuing Ion development [+footnote on fonts on 5800xm]
Message-ID: <slrnhb45b7.pi0.tuomov@beer.modeemi.cs.tut.fi>


Since I've been asked a few times whether it's possible for
someone to adopt or continue the development of Ion, now that
I'm unlikely to work on it, I thought I should post my thoughts
here on the list.

First of all, as it always has been, it is, of course, possible 
for people to fork a _renamed_ project, and develop it into
whatever direction. But, for various reasons, such complete 
forks are not entirely desirable, and it would be better if
any new developments that fit under the banner "Ion" could
keep using this name.

I always intended Ion3plus as a sort of "wiki branch", where
most patches fitting some loose guidelines are welcome, and
that still remains the case.. but I won't waste time applying
them to the repositories (darcs and my scripts being broken on
Cygwin, etc.), anyone taking over its maintenance would have 
to host it. These guidelines are there to keep the project
true to the name Ion, and therefore include

  * Quality code
  * A veto for me for major changes that do not simply enhance
    existing features. XFascistType and Shitorama have snowball's
    chance in hell of getting into Ion. Ion runs on pure X11, not
    fugly complex extensions.

It's all, of course, a bit vague, as it should be; strict 
catch-all terms and licenses suck anyway, and more should 
be based on case-by-case negotations. Therefore, initially,
I would have to review all changes to see that whoever takes
over, can produce good code (or filter out bad code from 
others)... take it as a job negotation, or trial period. If
I'm satisfied with the results, then there shall be more 
free hands but, still, attempts at the scale of adding
Shitorama or XFuglyType should be passed through me (to 
be rejected). 

As for development after Ion3plus, which shouldn't 
_fundamentally_ stray too far from Ion3, I have some new
ideas to try for Ion4, that I'd still like to see implemented.
I just doubt I'm going to do it myself... I'd really like
to move to the management department already, and have
someone else do the gruntwork. I'm not yet ready to just
give up the ideas, for various reasons, but if there's 
good work on Ion3plus... or other arrangements are reached
that ensure that they're implemented in Ion instead of 
a clone... I will consider that. I would also require
at that point that Ion be ported to Windows and, why not, 
OS X at. Not necessarily as a full WM, but rather as an
"IDE" managing some nicely behaving embeddable applications. 
If I magically found the time and interest to actually do 
the gruntwork on Ion4, it would most likely be a Windows 
program in any case. (Unless Apple somehow decided to add 
a Trackpoint on their laptops and support unblurred fonts 
- or screen resolutions quadrupled[1] - and my T43 died 
so I had to buy current shallowscreen crap.)

---

[1] To replace my 5 year old phone with dying battery, and 6 year
old mp3 player, I recently got a Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, as it 
was the only sub-300e touchscreen phone with standard USB and 
headphone sockets. (Easily loseable adapters suck. On the 
downside, no charging off USB, which some competitors' more
expensive models would have. But you can get two two of these
for the price of an iTrendClown & co.)

I like the touchscreen. With hand-writing recognition (which
could admittedly perform even better), it makes the device 
vastly more usable than T9 or even a mini-keyboard. But 
that is not the topic of this footnote, so no more on that.

The device blurry fonts. Perhaps surprisingly, they're not actually
that bad in the ?main interface. Partly this can be attributed to 
the "graphical" interface style, partly to usage, partly to choice
of font, but mostly to the 230dpi screen, which makes sub-100dpi 
desktop displays and even ~120dpi laptop displays pale in comparison.
By usage I mean that you don't read text for extended lengths 
on the phone, as on the computer. By choice of font I mean that
the font in the interface is simple and thick, so the proportion
of blurred pixels is small. It's not so great for reading texts, 
and the thinner font in the browser handles the blurring much 
more poorly. But, still, it's vastly more tolerable than on 
soddy computer displays resolutions, which are still the
technological equivalent of the PC beeper, which could not
play real music tolerably, only music designed for it.

Still, despite the blurring being more tolerable on the phone
than I expected, it confirms that 200dpi is not enough resolution
in serious use and with a wide range of fonts, for blurring not 
to annoy. And, yet, OS makers keep pushing on the blur-fascist 
front.

Hi all

I'm trying to compile 

	http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/download.html

on my FreeBSD 8.0-RC1 and didn't success....

I would like to known if anyone can help me make ion work ? Maybe someone
have the patch file for the system.mk ? 

Long time ago ion ports was kick off from the ports system because the will
of the developper (please don't troll). I just saw the license just change
maybe now it's possible to put again ion in the ports system ? 

I would like to help for the ports but as you can see I unable to build for
myself.

Regards

I'm happy to see I'm not the only ET (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/)
to like this wm ;-)

Well I've just try you tar....but it's not working.

Finally after 3 h I get a system.mk working. 

I'm sure every normal developper can do better. But for me I've my ion
working ;-)

You right again....

It's work...I don't known why (I'm not a FreeBSD-ports guru...) if I try to
build outside the ports tree, just with the patch file it's don't wokr.

But inside de ports tree it's working.

I'm using 

	FreeBSD-8.0-RC1

with all ports up2date.

Thanks for Dmitry for this ports. I'm going to keep this thing somewhere

Well I think you decision is already take so I'm not going argue with you.
Just little information : As I understand Tuomo Valkonen as stop the
developement of this software. Here is what he say :

 ?I have recently given up on the failure known as Linux, and switched to
 Windows. As I thus probably won't be working much on Ion3 anymore, and
 since it seems very stable anyway, the 28-day clause in the license should
 serve little practical purpose anymore. It has therefore been lifted.?
 
 	--> http://www.modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/news.html

Anyway if you don't want that ports I can understand easily why. That make
me sad, but thanks to Dmitry I can use ion-3  and because ion-3 not
going to evolve I'm going to keep that ?pseudo-ports? in some ?safe?-place.

Regards.
