TV&gt; My present plan is that each tag has a sparse bitmap associated 
TV&gt; with it, with the bit for each object ID that has that tag set, set
TV&gt; to one. Then you just 'and' these bitmaps when you search for the
TV&gt; subset of files having the given tags set. This should be quite
TV&gt; efficient given a suitable sparse structure for the bitmaps. 

You probably want inversion lists for this.  They are very efficient
for sparse membership, and extend to N members easily since they are
just linked lists internally.

TV&gt; There's, however, another structure needed for looking up a particular
TV&gt; file with exactly given set of tags. One approach would be to use a 
TV&gt; binary self-balancing tree (red-black, AVL), but I'm afraid that could
TV&gt; be too inefficient on a file system, as multiple 'inodes' all around the
TV&gt; disk would have to be accessed on each lookup. An alternative, possibly
TV&gt; more efficient, approach would be to order the identifier sets by tag ID,
TV&gt; and use a nested B-tree for looking up the files as if they were on a 
TV&gt; normal hierachical file system. In fact, you could store the files on 
TV&gt; a normal underlying file system in that hierarchy. I do not plan to do
TV&gt; so, however, although I do intend to use (at least initially) a normal
TV&gt; FS for storing the files, with an additional file for the indices.

Have you considered SQLite or something similar?  Even if you don't
use on a DB backend eventually, I think using it at first would make
your life easier because the prototype will be easier to produce.

I also think the tag ideas would apply nicely to Ion3 elements.  Right
now, &quot;goto window,&quot; for example, has just the tab-completion interface
by name.  It could use tags by window class, workspace type and
number, etc.  Just a thought for Ion3plus.
