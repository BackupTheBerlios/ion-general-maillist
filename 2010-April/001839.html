First, thanks for starting this thread! I did notice that Tuomov's pages
were down, but since his whole site was down, I was waiting for it to
come back without realizing he might have taken the whole project down.
Quick question: do we know for sure Tuomov has severed connections with
ion3 permanently or is this our best guess at this point?

ion3 has been my primary environment for a while now, and I won't
consider changing. I love its design, philosophy, and simplicity, but
I'm preaching to the choir here.

I'm all for forking into /one/ fork, and that too only because of the
licensing issue--please lets not make multiple messy forks. Like a few
of you, I don't have much time either right now, but expect to be able
to contribute a more a few months down the line. But I can contribute
towards getting us going right now if needed.

We have at least a few tasks to accomplish ASAP just so we don't lose
continuity or momentum (please suggest other things that need to be done
too):

- We need a new name and so far, I personally like both &quot;notion&quot; (my top
  favorite) and &quot;neon&quot;. Do we have any other nominations? Note that we
  can always change the name later. It's good to get moving on things
  even based on a temporary name if we can't reach consensus.

- We need to get the codebase including the latest set of sources (easy,
  many of us have this), and also as much of the associated git repos as
  we can.

- We need a central place to get ourselves organized and store code. I
  nominate sourceforge (well established, well known, supports git).
  I've speculatively created a new 'notion' project (we can change
  name, details, or even the site later):

 &#160;<A HREF="http://notion.sourceforge.net/">http://notion.sourceforge.net/</A>

- We need 2 or 3 managers and/or lead devlopers. IMHO, managers do
  not&#160;/necessarily/ need to have in-depth code knowledge, and
  lead&#160;developers do not need to necessarily manage, though this can all
  be&#160;the same person. Any volunteers?
