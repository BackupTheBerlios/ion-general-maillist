I never said that at all actually. But that's ok. Also, the fact that the
bindings are in lua is unrelated to the difficulty in editing them for
normal people, lua is designed to be used for configuration services and
as such can be made to look rather config-file-like. The ion config system
doesn't do that much, but that's ok.

Actually the basic operations have changed quite a bit since ion3 started,
in a couple places. And like I said you just move the failure point, and
like I also said a translation script is not at all hard to handle.

Actually this doesn't need to touch Tuomo at all it can be entirely with a
runtime script which reads your simplified binding file and makes the
right lua calls.
