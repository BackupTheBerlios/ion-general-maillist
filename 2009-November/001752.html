Not quite. Such a generic scripting interface inherently has to stick to
the lowest common denominator.. and hence it should really not be the
main extension/scripting interface, I think, but a more simplified 
&quot;command interface&quot;.. For more thoughts on this, see

&quot;Baawaawaa, it's not written in My Language Of Choice, so it must be
rewritten.&quot; That describes something like 49% of FOSS projects
The other 49% is &quot;baawaawaa, it's not Free&#9441;: it doesn't use My 
License of Choice&quot;. The remaining 2% may have some originality.

There really is not much to learn in Lua, and if you can't pick up 
a language  &quot;on the go&quot; -- especially as simple one as lua, with 
a very short official reference manual -- you shouldn't be programming
at all. It's not like you need a high level of proficiency for 
scripting. I've written plugins for programs written in perl, ruby,
and python, and I have never taken the time to properly learn them, 
don't really like them (Lua is _much_ better, except for the 
library selection), and would not start a project using them 
myself, unless there was some very compelling reason (library 
availability or such).

&gt;<i> which I find far less versatile and readable than my language of choice. 
</I>
Then you haven't even bothered reading the basic description of the
language, and are criticising just because it's not Your Language of
Choice.

&gt;<i> Again, this may be just a matter of taste, but in any case, I do not feel 
</I>&gt;<i> like messing with lua, and I think it should not be imposed.
</I>
It's not imposed. As far as I know, nobody has to use Ion, as it's
a marginal alternative among a gazillion other window managers.
It's not XFascistType, pukedev, Hardware Obstruction Layer (of
the Year) or other core software that the only way to avoid is 
to not use Linux/*nix. Which is exactly what I have done.

&gt;<i> My suggestion? Why not make ion controllable through IPC? maybe a fifo, 
</I>&gt;<i> socket, tcp, whatever, to _let the user choose_ the language to be used.
</I>
Why don't you do that?

Actually there is mod_ionflux, that you can use to send Lua code...

&gt;<i> I'm not saying that ion should be redesigned and reimplemented right away 
</I>&gt;<i> either. It will definitely be rewritten from scratch at some point I guess, 
</I>&gt;<i> so why not keep this in mind when the time comes?
</I>
Ion is not being developed.  For details on any possible future, see
