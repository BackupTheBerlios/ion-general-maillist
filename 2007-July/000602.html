And double that in .fi... if it were available. It's also still
rather big with a 14.1&quot; screen... The S61 (w/ 12.1&quot;) that I found
by googling for the former is more to the size, although still 
quite heavy (1.5kg). The UMPCs are more to my liking than normal
laptops actually, but still not good enough (too crappy screen
size to device size ratio). I'd like something that can be carried
in a (rather big) pocket (pocket book sized), but not as small
and useless as crappy PDAs or iDiotphones (haven't seen anything
&quot;smart&quot; about them yet).

&gt;<i> I am on runit (daemontools alike--just better IMO) for

Doesn't help when the system tries to load every single
kernel module that it can find -- and ends up placing
the devices in random order. (But then again, Linux has
become totally useless recently with all HDs always in
random order, even without the module lottery.)

&gt;<i> It's a trade-off: non notebook hard disks are not built

</I>
The disks spin up approximately once a day, which they would in
any case if it was easier to actually shut down the computer 
without shutting down the programs... which Linux doesn't make
easy enough, unlike Windows. (And one could optimise the spin 
downs a bit with an option to noflushd (or an awful hack that
I'm too lazy to write) to have longer delays for spindown
during the day than night.)

&gt;<i> Why do you think such a thing, and others similar,
</I>&gt;<i> need to be put in the statusbar?
</I>
It's a nice place. You could also use some (unicode) block character
hacks for a rather compact bar display... or a systray icon. OSD 
can be nice for warnings and such, but I wouldn't want the screen
constantly littered with information.
