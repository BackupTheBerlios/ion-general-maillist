</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; First, thanks for starting this thread! I did notice that Tuomov's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; pages were down, but since his whole site was down, I was waiting 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for it to come back without realizing he might have taken the whole 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; project down.  Quick question: do we know for sure Tuomov has 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; severed connections with ion3 permanently or is this our best guess 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; at this point?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's a pretty solid guess...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tuomo responded to an email on this list on March 22.  Maybe he's just 
</I>&gt;<i> on vacation.   He's complained often about the lack of good, simple web 
</I>&gt;<i> hosting.
</I>
Tuomo's website 404'd, the rest of the (host) website and all the other
accounts look pretty fine to me, doesn't seem like a problem with the
host at all (although it's still possible).

&gt;<i>  Seems slightly hasty to not wait to hear from the man himself 
</I>&gt;<i> that the project is &quot;abandoned&quot;-abandoned (as opposed to &quot;I've switched 
</I>&gt;<i> to Windows, and don't plan to support this&quot;).
</I>
i believe forking was already on a lot of people's minds for some time
now (as somebody else mentioned), the fact that the website is no longer
available merely served as a motivation.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ion3 has been my primary environment for a while now, and I won't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; consider changing. I love its design, philosophy, and simplicity, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; but I'm preaching to the choir here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm all for forking into /one/ fork, and that too only because of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the licensing issue--please lets not make multiple messy forks. Like 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a few of you, I don't have much time either right now, but expect to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be able to contribute a more a few months down the line. But I can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; contribute towards getting us going right now if needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I don't understand everyone's reluctance to even consider 
</I>&gt;<i> changing.
</I>
not true, i suggest you dig deeper into this thread...

&gt;<i> Ion's great 'n all, but without extremely committed 
</I>&gt;<i> leadership, there doesn't seem to be much point to forking.  (Either it 
</I>&gt;<i> will remain the useful tool it is and only get bugfixes, or it'll bitrot 
</I>&gt;<i> completely.)  Why not branch out and get other similar-minded window 
</I>&gt;<i> managers (under active development) to incorporate some of what you love 
</I>&gt;<i> about ion?
</I>
now why didn't 'we' think of that?

i believe anybody who could have left has already done so. so...


&gt;<i> Guessing that won't be a popular sentiment, but whatever.  Not trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> completely discourage anyone -- just adding my $.02.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
we're ion users, we are used to unpopular sentiments; we should get a
prise or something.
