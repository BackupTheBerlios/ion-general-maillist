<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I think that would be a very useful way to switch to the frame you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want, just move the cursor until it's over that frame, should normally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only take a couple of keystrokes.
</I>
If you really want to do that, I suggest a Trackpoint keyboard instead.
The difficult a foresee with key(board) control of the pointer -- based
on experience with keyboard resize -- is control of the acceleration.
You need some kind of acceleration for fast yet precise movement of the
pointer, but with an on/off control device you have to do it based on
hacks based on the time pressed, which is hacky and does not work so
well. Trackpoint, on the other hand, does it by the pressure you apply.
By applying little pressure, you can move the pointer very precisely;
by a large amount of pressure, you're on the other side of the screen
in no time. (Assuming you have sane almost maxed-out settings; the
defaults tend to be crappy, and maybe one of the reason many people 
give up on the Trackpoint, and become ice-skaters.)

&gt;<i> well, it's a bit like buying a car navigation system and then only using it
</I>&gt;<i> street by street ... maybe you should have a look at the commands ion
</I>&gt;<i> provides.
</I>
Isn't that what navigation systems are all about? If you actually 
bothered looking at the map for a moment, you wouldn't need some 
device to tell you where to go (wrong).
