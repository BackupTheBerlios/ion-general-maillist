People should not include unstable/development software in &quot;stable&quot;
distros. I'm not that annoyed with 20061223 being available now, but
with the new &quot;stable&quot; Debian still providing it when people ask for
&quot;ion3&quot;, two years from now, as seems likely to be the case. So from
two years from now, you still have to deal with lusers complaining
about it.

Debian/unstable does tend to normally have the latest release quite
quickly, except now, that they've freezen it too, and you already get
complaints from people using &quot;the latest&quot; -- in Debian. Gentoo, OTOH,
only sporadically update their ebuilds, and they don't seem to have
a proper maintainer either.. They seem to take the package directly
from the home page, however, so I can just remove the old ones...
And although occasionally you get some Gentoo user using some very
old locked version (well, not recently anymore, actually), most 
often the user complaining of an old development snapshot, is a 
Debian or Ubuntu user.

&gt;<i> or maybe forbid the use of `ion3' altogether? come on. tell you what: I'm

</I>&gt;<i> or remove `ion3' altogether?  mmh. could serve as a strategy to ensure that ion
</I>&gt;<i> users know each other personally in a few years.
</I>
You use whatever version you want and works for you, but if you don't use
the latest, stop complaining about any bugs and other glitches. Distros,
however, should provide the latest or deal themselves with the lusers 
ignorant of the fact that they're not using the latest and should thus 
keep their mouths shut. At the very least they should warn with das big
red blinkenletters that what they're using is old, to stay away from the
upstream, and provide the support themselves. Nobody forces any user to
upgrade something that works for them: the distro could easily ask if 
you want to upgrade to an incompatible version instead of doing it 
automagically. And I wish they did that, instead of breaking the system,
like Debian often does. But if you don't use the latest, be aware that 
you get no support, and are on your own.

I don't provide development snapshots with the intent of having to
support them years from now, which seems to be Debian's idea of
the matter.
