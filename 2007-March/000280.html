I'd rather not interfere with the standard  keybindings here: scratchpad
pops up with mod1+space. 

as I said already, I think the best way to pop up the tutorial would be
mod1+F1 which currently is bound to ion3 manpage (as is F1&lt;RET&gt;, which suffices
for getting to the manpage). I really don't see a point in popping up the help
in the scratchpad frame: it's by default and for good reason a rather small frame in
the middle of the screen. that's exactly what one wants here most of the time: a
small window where one can issue `make' or whatever). if you display a longer
document here, one _always_ would need to maximize the scratchpad first (if one
knows how to do it...). I find the current approach taken with the manpages via F1 much
more sensible: use whichever frame you happen to be in. same should
happen with the tutorial  when issuing mod1+F1.
usually this will than display in a large frame allowing to read the document in a sensible
way.

question: what are the ideas for achieving formatting? should this be written as a troff
manpage like the real manpage (might be OK)? or what else? I'd definitely
advocate to use something which allows to get sensible formatted output to the
terminal (just as `man'). if people are comfortable with it, I'd propose 'troff/ms'
wich would allow better control over formatting. (a bit of advertising for this
dinosaur: it's always there, just as `troff/man',  
it's definitely not more complicated than the `troff/man' macros and
it would allow easy integration of nicely formatted tables via the `tbl'
preprocessor' even for terminal output -- might be helpful for the keybinding
lists... and maybe(...) I could at least take over formatting if you feel
uncomfortable with it).

in eithcer case `man' and `ms' would allow to format into pdf, html, too. yes. TeX
would be working too (but not for sensible terminal output), but talking of
bloatware... and please, please: not texinfo... I think the best thing is to have
(as far as possible) nicely formatted output in a terminal which is piped
through `less' for navigation/searching.

and finally: I would'nt like to  have a permanent 'help' entry in the statusbar. 
I feel it should go in the F12 menu (together with `about', 'help'. here I would
argue to occupy the `help' entry with the new stuff and change the current
'help' to 'manpages' or 'man' because that's what it is). the user must somehow
have learned initially of the F12 menu otherwise he/she won't get out of ion3 at
all. another hint to the tutorial should go in the manpage (SEE ALSO), 
which one can expect that every users has had a look at .
