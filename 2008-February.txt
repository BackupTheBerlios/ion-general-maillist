Subject: winprop across multiple screens not working?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0802022300090.2222@localhost.localdomain>

I have a jumpto winprop for GQview that looks like this:

defwinprop{
   class     = "GQview",
   instance  = "gqview",
   jumpto    = true,
}

I have a multi-head setup using mod_xinerama (sorry, Tuomo, I'll understand if
you don't respond!).

The jumpto winprop doesn't seem to work across screens. As in, if I start
gqview from screen 1, and gqview is setup to open on screen 0. Or vice versa.

It works perfectly okay (and so does a float winprop for the same
class/instance) on single screen setups, or if the terminal I start gqview
from is on the same screen as the one gqview is setup to open in.

I have similar problems with skype chat windows.

Any ideas?

Thanks!

That seems to be a general conflict with the anti- pointer focus
stealing hack..

Well-well, Euler aside it's entertaining to see that this stable release of
Ion occurs simultaneously with the begin of the year of the ... rat [mouse] :)

See the Lunar Chinese Calendar.

Hey, all the real men use Emacs, right?
They start eterm, run telnet in it then establish SMTP connection and

This comic is really impressive and loads of fun for geeks.
Once you've browsed everything, you may be interested in reading
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xkcd#Life_imitates_xkcd
http://blag.xkcd.com/2007/11/19/growing-up/
http://blag.xkcd.com/2007/10/01/the-meetup/

just to be convinced this guy must be a mage of some kind.

Real men think emacs are electrically powered trucks, or something, dude.

Trendy men fathom that emacs is the plural of eMac.

Geeks think emacs is a text editor.

?ber-geeks know that it is an operating system... albeit a very clunky one.

So what about configuring your screen to use Ctrl-G instead:

$ cat ~/.screenrc
escape ^G^G
termcapinfo xterm 'hs:ts=\E]2;:fs=\007:ds=\E]2;screen\007'
termcapinfo rxvt 'hs:ts=\E]2;:fs=\007:ds=\E]2;screen\007'
hardstatus string "%H [screen %n%?: %t%?] %h"

Thank you Tuomo,

I've just finished compiling and installing the stable release and
nothing broke ;)

I'll wait patiently for the 2016 release. Thanks again.

It's not the same kind of coincidences. The Chinese new year doesn't occur at
the same date modulo one year ... examples:

     Chinese new year dates

     2012 - Jan. 23

while on both 1990-02-07 and 1992-02-07 there was no Ion yet.

By the way, to use wikipedia.org on geopolitics in general, and on the former
Soviet Union in particular, is like to use the Vatican as reference for
telling on ...?! the 'position of the lotus'; Microsoft on Ion; and Wander
[Switzerland] of the chocolate beverage Ovomaltine on the Russian vodka
Stolichnaya.

Moreover: good luck--but hey: good riddance--to call the *creation* of the EU
[perhaps incorporated Europe?] the "birth of an empire."

Trusting the actual content of wikipedia... *shudder*. But there's 
some hope that they can get the date of an actual event correct. 
(At least the Wikipedia pages on those subjects agreed with the 
February_7 listing, which is better than things often are.)

Much lesser things are called empires.

They have some useful ideas, but the system stinks too much
of obsolete and unix... and rats.

Everything's a file... great, but could we move past text files
with a proprietary syntax, and having to parse them with quick
and dirty hacks? How about a more efficient standard structural
_binary_ format? For all the pipes too? And the shell, kind of 
like Microsoft PowerShell, but better? (Instead of piping objects
with a display routine among other things, piping structural data
with specified stylesheet for display kind of like XML files, but
without the inefficient text encoding of XML.)

As for the kernel... how about an exokernel? (Or at least what
I've understood it to be: basically the kernel provides only 
memory management, with disk pages handled analoguously like 
memory pages, abstracting away the actual devices. Even a lot
of the memory management is on user-side, with the kernel just
verifying claims, or so.) As for security, how about an object
capability system (see: EROS, Coytos, CapROS) in user space 
outside the exokernel? 

And the user interface beyond the command line? Vis. 

And so on. I have and there must be more ideas along similar 
lines, and if one really started spending time thinking about 
it and unifying them, one might be able to come up with a 
very nice, clean and flexible design, intead of a random 
clusterfuck.

Message-ID: <873as4pg8c.fsf@cadilhac.name>

Hi there?!

I'm a lousy programmer when graphical things are concerned?; but heck, I
more than often need to measure the distance between two points on my
screen.  I think it's not worth learning the (huge) basics of Qt just to
be able to make a screen ruler, so I was wondering if there's a simple
way to do that within Ion itself.

The simplest way would probably be to assign a key to "The current
position of the cursor is point A", then upon re-hit "The curr.. point
B" and print the result (|A-B|) somewhere.

Any idea??  TIA!

See the recent post about luatcc, and man XQueryPointer.
Or just use XQueryPointer in a custom program.
Maybe there already is one.

The stench most of us live in. But very true.

A very interesting idea.. Can't say I've touched powershell. I think
idea of a XML like stylesheet for output is a good one. I'd be very
interesting to see this shell.

What about the other kernel tasks? Just handled by other processes in
userspace? That'd be very interesting and very cool. Abstraction is
very very good. I wouldn't imagine writing an OS that wouldn't include
device abstraction (for drives, at the very least).

Of course we'd probably need much better user input devices. Something
like a dataglove would be fantastic.

Well, you can't NOT have a random clusterfuck with most OSS shit. (/me
points at PHP).  Not that I don't like OSS, actually, but still.

Mostly, yes. Scheduler may need to be in the kernel. Dunno how it
is in existing exokernels, but they do not e.g. include message-
passing as microkernels too. That's handled by user side through
the kernel-provided memory management. File systems are obviously
in user space.. and programs can simply directly allocate disk
pages from the kernel, if they don't care to use a file system 
service. (Over reboots they somehow have to remember their
root pages, however. This is actually related to the orthogonal
persistence of EROS.)

Actually, I see the lightweight exokernel as a somewhat of a 
return to the golden age of DOS. Device drivers can be abstracted
as libraries too, when the device doesn't have to be shared, and
any program can use the library. The kernel just takes care that 
no two processes use the device's memory space simultaneously. 
Now, obviously a sound server that mixes multiple streams is a 
useful one, as is a display multiplexer, but you don't particularly
need a specific low-level driver service, but rather drivers within
such much higher level services. Basically a bit like the X server
presently is actually, but hopefully without its reliability 
problems.. (also to consider how to do DRI shit nicely while not
giving any bloated and unreliable program full control of such 
a critical resource).

As mentioned on this list previously there is a set of tools called
xautomation, one of those tools is the xmousepos tool which,
unsurprisingly, gets and sets the location of the mouse cursor. That
should give you what you need for your 'simplest' case.

I don't know about other distributions but debian has it packaged as
'xautomation' if yours doesn't the homepage is
http://hoopajoo.net/projects/xautomation.html .

P.S. I'm curious why you need to measure the distance between two points
on your screen with such regularity.

Here's an honest question: what language do people think the next operating
system, the one that Ion users are most likely to write, will be written in? C
is the default choice, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was something else...

I don't have a guess, myself. I have no experience yet. What I would like to
see, however, is a new language designed for the new task of writing a modern
operating system. But even then, what features would this language have?

If only I was wealthy, or could magically procure grants for myself. I'd love to
research these questions.

Thank you for repeating that, then?:-)

Gentoo has a package called `xautomation', but it dates back to 2004?; I
wonder why.  At that time, I suppose the package didn't include the
xmousepos binary.

I use a lot of maps?:-) If they're on a website (for instance google
maps), I usually screenshot the page and open it in the Gimp.

Thanks again.

Thank you very much, Tuomo, especially for your unfailing promptness.
What I was coding was pretty much the same as xmousepos(1), so I'll use
that.

Happy hacking.

C.. and then some.

There's just no way around it: for any serious work you want C.
Or maybe some other relatively simple language close to the 
hardware, with better safety... and tagged unions. (What was 
this one C derivative?) But the benefits of such an alternative
(except for tagged unions) are not so great, because you only
want to write relatively simple things in C/it. You don't want
to write much abstractions in C. You do low level gruntwork of 
core libraries in C, provide a very simple API, and use whatever
language you want with better abstractions and better safety 
(hence typically no dynamically-typed scripting languages, but 
rather e.g. Haskell), to access the services provided by the C 
core libraries. This is easy because the API is simple (instead 
of OO bloat).

Non-performance critical libraries could also be written in 
other languages (such as Haskell), and they could provide a
simple C API, but conflicting runtimes present a problem. Many
languages (including Haskell, java, etc.) want to be operating
systems themselves these days. 

Instead of using the operating system's namespace to locate their
libraries, they want to impose their own module and package 
namespaces and hierarchies.

Instead of exposing the operating system's libraries and services,
and letting the program author choose either some real platform 
or a compatibility layer (platform), they want you to use their 
own compatibility layer. Megalomania pure and simple. And in 
exchange cross-language compatibility is reduced. For that you
either you either have to write for the "C runtime" (i.e. the OS),
or you need something like CLR (common language runtime). 

I think the C option could promote better API practises instead
of OO-bloat. You _do_ often want to write higher-level APIs suited
to the practises and mechanisms of any particular language, instead
of enforcing an uniform one. Those exposing a simple easy wrappable
API not dependent on the idiosyncracies of any particular language
or design methodology (such as OO-bloat), should work best.

It has been done already--in (significantly) less than eight years, an by
mainly just two people only: Niklaus Wirth and Juerg Gutknecht, from the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology in Zuerich [ETHZ]. It's the Oberon OS, and
it's written in Oberon [the homonym programming language].

I would prefer Modula-3 ... among the nicest programming languages I know:
based on Modula-2 minus its problematic features, VERY NICE, tiny, yet
POWERFUL, SIMPLE, EFFICIENT and FAST, supporting interfaces, objects,
generics, lightweight threads, isolation of unsafe code, garbage collection,
exceptions and subtyping.

The fact is [I think] that Modula-3 has been a DEC [Digital Equipment] and
Olivetti project, not an ETHZ one, and that Modula-3 has outclassed the
original Oberon by far. [Wirth has not been/is ?! not an easy man.]

So do things go, unfortunately: a gem of a programming language-Modula-3--who
has been unjustly [or maybe actively?] *forgotten* or *marginalized* with the
exception of Canada, perhaps. (As another example, the winner of Ada [83] has
also not been the most promising project.) And a programming language which is
still unsurpassed today, under many perspectives, and *modern*. One galaxy or
two aside, compared with C, in any case. [Python's Guido van Rossum claims to
have been inspired by Modula-3, to let us understand.]

With Ada [tasking, among other things] and Eiffel [design by contract],
both contemporary to Modula-3, the job of truly innovating in the domain of
programming languages has reached its zenith, likely.

Anyway, there are *free* implementations of Modula-3 though.

Then I know that an experimental OS has been written in Ada[83],
and that the OS has been said to be slow. (I would not chose
Ada.)

I would stay away from C++.

Cheers,

/Roy

I think it is impossible to avoid the mid-level because in the near
future there will be a lot of platforms which are differs on a hardware
level (e.g. mobiles, desktops, computing nets, brain chips etc), and a
lot of low-level OSes on it.  We need a kind of an API-buffer like .NET
for portability of a software.  So the point of application of kernel
development will shift to development of a kernel of that API-buffer, IMHO.

Low-level doesn't mean completely unportable/hardware-level. Just very low
abstraction level, just like C. High level by contrast is very high
abstraction level.

hardware or ultra-low-level 
           = asm / port-poking / "use the source"
low-level  = C / exokernel / decent config files
mid-level  = C++ / linux megamonolith / wimpshit
high-level = Haskell 
             / high level services on top
               of a low-level or mid-level kernel ... or Haskell :)
             / just doing the right thing

Or something like that. Obviously the level depends on the 
perspective.

Those scripts are probably broken and hang the statusd.

One should just use luasocket, to avoid executing programs 
all the time. And ioncore.popen_bgread instead io.popen
stops one monitor listening to a hung program from hanging
the whole statusd.

Of course, I also recommend moc(p), which doesn't demand
a bloated redundant playlist library, but provides good
support for your existing filing system -- the directory
hierarchy.

I am the only one seeing this, do I have messed up with my TeX/etc.

I am using rubber-1.1, a stock Slackware [current] tetex-3.0-i486-5,
latex2html-2002-2-1, and a non-stock xpdf-3.02.sec-patched.

Works for me at home, not at work. (La)TeX is a messed up POS anyway,
but unfortunately there's nothing better. Note that there's no need
for you to build the documents, the package contains prebuilt ones.

Are you in full screen mode when the window opens? How about different
terminal emulator? Ion version?

For the record there is also C/Invoke (http://www.nongnu.org/cinvoke/)
which has lua bindings as well as the newer (just released) Alien
(http://alien.luaforge.net/) both of which give lua ffi to C libraries
directly.

Yeah, those seem even better... unless you need the constants,
in which case TCC seems simpler than parsing them with some
scripts included in alien or so.

Message-ID: <2df5ce20802160448p6461aa24h5317d4634949c057@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a strange behavior on my ASUS EeePC under debian. I've installed ion3
since a while, and today, when I try to have a scratchpad, nothing happens.
I've checked my configuration, but I didn't find anything, I have a
dopath("mod_sp") in my cfr_defaults.lua. I've tried to change the shortcut,
but nothing happens. I cannot remember if I've do anything to cause that
behavior ;( And even with the stupid 'uninstall/reinstall' thing, I haven't
solve my problem

Any idea?

Thanks in advance,

Manu

There's no cfr_defaults.lua, and I strongly suggest you don't touch 
cfg_defaults.lua. It is meant to provide the default settings (if
nothign else is loaded from cfg_ion.lua), not to be modified by users.
cfg_ion.lua is to be modified by users.

Subject: the workspacelist like the focuslist
Message-ID: <47B9440D.7040108@yandex.ru>

Hello!

I have a zillion applications running on more than ten workspaces so the
focuslist became unusable.  But focuslist has a nice feature, it sorted
by activity flag.  I wanted it for workspacelist and first I wrote this
hack into my cfg_local.lua just to try whether this way works or not:

function workspacelist_unsrt()
   local entries={}
   local iter_=addto(entries)

   local function addto(list)
      return function(tgt, attr)
		local e=menuentry(tgt:name(), function() tgt:goto() end)
		e.attr=attr;
		table.insert(list, e)
		return true
	     end
   end

   local function iter(obj)
      return (not obj_is(obj, "WGroupWS") or iter_(obj))
   end

   ioncore.region_i(iter)

   return entries
end


defbindings("WScreen", {
kpress(META.."Q", "mod_menu.menu(_, _sub, 'workspacelist_unsrt')"),
})


So, it didn't.  Nothing happend at all.  A hoped to see a menu with
unsorted list of workspaces.  What did I wrong?

Well, I'll be nice if someone promts me how to do a list of workspaces
recently used.


Best witches,
Evgeny

This is the Debian and lua5.1 was installed from distro, but ion3 was an
officiallest tarball installed into /usr/local.

Ok...

The menu system doesn't know about your menu generator.
You're missing a defmenu.

Dunno what you're using, if you expect such behaviour. In Ion, 
as I have defined it, you have to explicitly set the name in 
the layout: the 'target' could refer to a frame or such thing
within the group.

Mutt is lame, if uses atime. It should use just ctime.

(It is possible to *lie* about the atime by setting it to
another value with the utimes syscall. I consider such
very bad behaviour rid with race conditions, that should
be avoided in normal circumstances.)

defctxmenu("WFrame", "Frame", {

If you want operations on WClientWins, you should use the corresponding
context; cf. the Kill operation in default settings. (Perhaps it would
be better to implement rqclose_propagate too by binding Mod1+C and Close
in multiple places... but that's equally ugly really.)

It could be caused by broken scripts. Otherwise, this is a mystery
problem that I've never met, and nobody has been able to provide 
any solid evidence about.

Hi Tuomo,

I'm running ion3-20080207 on Debian, installed from native debian
package ion3-20080207-1.

Since I upgraded to this package, the code, that was working
flawlessly before, started to trow errors.  Here is the snippet of
offending code:

        local tf = ioncore.lookup_region("WFrameSS", "WFrame")
        local wg = tf:attach_new({type = "WGroupCW", switchto = t.switchto})
        local opt = {type = "WTiling", name = c, dir = "horizontal",
switchto = t.switchto, bottom = true,
            split_tree = {type = "WSplitSplit", dir = "horizontal",
tls = 1, brs = 1,
            tl = {type = "WSplitRegion", regparams = {type = "WFrame",
name = c.."-left"}},
            br = {type = "WSplitRegion", regparams = {type = "WFrame",
name = c.."-right"}}}}
        local ws = wg:attach_new(opt)

And now it says (refferring to the last line of the of the snippet):

ion3: /home/alte/etc/.ion3/mod_smallscreen.lua:124: attempt to index
local 'wg' (a nil value)

As I understand this, 'attach_new' call returns 'nil' in this version
of ion3 for the reasons not very clear to me.

Could you please comment on how to update the code to make it work in
new version of ion?

Thanks in advance,

Alexander

It's possible to write a script.. (^G and ^C also work for closing
the queries and messages, btw.)

You can not create empty WGroupCWs. (Consider loading a saved layout
without the old client windows (CQW) to be found. These types of 
groups have been tuned for groups as client window containers.) 
What you probably want is WGroupWS (groups tuned for workspace 
usage). Also, you're doing things the clumsy way by repeated
attach_new. You can simply include the second layout in the
first attach_new: managed = { opt }.

Thanks a lot for the hint!  Creating non-empty WGroupCW (btw, I really
wanted WGroupCW and not WGroupWS) works flawlessly.  However, the next
bit of code, that used to work under previous ion3 version, started to
fail.  The code now looks as follows (I'm simplifying it a bit for the
sake of readability, but you'll get the idea):

local tf = ioncore.lookup_region("WFrameSS", "WFrame")
local opt = {type = "WTiling", name = c, dir = "horizontal", switchto
= t.switchto, bottom = true,
   split_tree = {type = "WSplitSplit", dir = "horizontal", tls = 1, brs = 1,
   tl = {type = "WSplitRegion", regparams = {type = "WFrame", name =
c.."-left"}},
   br = {type = "WSplitRegion", regparams = {type = "WFrame", name =
c.."-right"}}}}
local wg = tf:attach_new({type = "WGroupCW", switchto = t.switchto,
managed = { opt }})
fr = wg:bottom():split_tree():br():reg()
fr:set_mode("tiled-alt")
fr:attach_new({type = "WGroupCW", switchto = t.switchto, managed =
{{reg = cwin, bottom = true}}})

This gives no errors, but cwin gets attached to WFrame named
"WFrameSS" (a top one), and not to a newly created "Gimp-right"
WFrame.  Once again, I have no idea at all how this happens, the code
worked just fine under previous versions of ion3.

It should work. Does set_mode operate on the correct frame?

Yes, 'set_mode' operates as expected, modifying the right frame.

A couple of hints that can help you to track down the issue:

First, this code operates inside 'clientwin_do_manage_alt' hook.  Inside
another 'clientwin_do_manage_alt' hook doing absolutely different thing
I have the same problem - the window is not added to a newly created
WGroupCW.

Second, attaching WClientWin to the same frame in ioncore.defer works
just fine.  This could be a solution, but I cannot create an empty
WGroupCW and later attach WClientWin in ioncore.defer instead of
'clientwin_do_manage_alt' hook.

You do return 'true' from your hook handler?

Sure.  Otherwise the hook would fall miserably.

Have you checked that your hook handler finishes without failing?
Have you checked (by adding debugging code to your script), where
the window is attached after return from the attach call (and not
just after all the management code)?

Does the panel.lua script from the repository work for you?

The hook finishes ok.  Checking cwin after the return from attach_new()
gives a very clear picture: cwin does not get reparented, cwin:manager()
returns nil.

Panel.lua does not make much sense in my case - I run almost all the
windows fullscreen, no panels or anything.

Do you get anything in stderr? What does the attach call itself return?
Is the group created? Are you sure cwin points to the correct object?

nil.  My understanding is it should return WRegion.  Thus, I quote the
call again:

t in nil after that.  ft is non-nil.

Yes.  It appears alongside the mapped window.  As I said, ft is pointing
at correct WFrame.

Judging by cwin:name(), it does.

Hello list,

I've got a small question: how do I remove all window decorations around
a specific client window?  I'd like to have my Audacious without any
decorations...

cu, Adam.

Basically, you can't. It's very intentional.

In case of tiled frames, you can in principle define the tiled-alt
style to have no decorations. (By default it has no tab-bar.) But
the borders between frames are typically formed from the decorations
of frames on both sides of the border.

The One True OS is just a new name for The One True Editor.

I'm not sure how "great" it will be, but very likely it the next
popular OS will be written in broken javascript on top of a stinking
pile of C, C++, shell scripts, python, perl, mono, and other flaky
hacks. Otherwise known as webshit-on-gnomefox-on-linux.

Install the Firefox Web Developer toolbar.  Miscellaneous->Show Ruler.
You can also find the size of a particular image or any other screen
element with Information -> Display Element Information (Ctrl-Shift-F).

The Firefox Firebug extension also has measurements, easily accessible
in the context menu Inspect Element -> Layout tab on the right.  It does
many things the Web Developer toolbar doesn't, so I always install both.

(Actually my dictionary is probably wrong -- they often are -- 
claiming "jigging" is  "pilkkiminen", and it's really just 
"ice fishing".)

I can't fully blame myself for missing this post in the first place
(being in a hospital and not owning a bluetooth-enabled cellphone),
but it's congratulations nevertheless!
Despite of the disagreements I might have posted against you, I still
think I owe you some beer (not having a chance to meet in person back
a while ago when I used to live in Finland). :)

I'm kinda on it for a while now, although not nearly as ready for
anything yet. Still, this post gives me sort of an ass kick, therefore
I'd like to continue this conversation more subject-wise, like
collecting ideas and opinions and with a higher seriousness than that
of "hey, I'm writing a new operating system, it'll be mostly like
linux, except for I'm the author" approach that I can possibly call
for. Thanks for bringing this up.

Yeah, I think it is lame to (seriously) work on clone software with 
just minor tweaking (Yet Another Distro/WM/whatever). Instead one 
should take an entirely new approach, or at least turn a research
project into more practical software. In large scale systems, such
as an entire OS, that does seem to require too long an attention 
span for the modern culture, however. Not that it wouldn't be possible
to get to the desired end result with incremental improvement, but
first one has to be able to define that, to not end up with a 
complete clusterfuck.

Anyway, I'm all for a simple low-level core system (such as an 
exokernel) with capability-based security and various high-level
abstractions on top of it (typed pipes/shells, a decent config 
system abstract to applications, decent decentralised package 
management, vis, etc., just to throw some ideas around).

You can't disable it, because the app asks it to be mapped. 
You can, however, e.g. load the dock module, have the dock
manage the window, and keep the dock hidden.

Actually, now that I recall it, I _did_ add floating-alt (transient-alt,
etc.) modes as well. And by default he floating-alt style also has no
tab-bar.
