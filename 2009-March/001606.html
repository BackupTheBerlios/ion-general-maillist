Both cores.. doing fine with just one. Only really notice the scanner
at login, which takes ages, just like the boot too. But with reliable
standby/hibernate, it's not necessary to boot often, and you can still
shut down the system for the night, etc. 

&gt;<i> e.g. you can't overwrite a file, when it is executed.

</I>
This is indeed a major annoyance that you can't delete a file
in use, as on *nix. At least in cygwin they can, however, be 
renamed out of the way. I've been told this should've been
improved in Vista.

&gt;<i> A path in NTFS is not allowed to be longer than 255 chars... 
</I>
Path? You mean file name? It's the same on ext2/3 as far as I
recall, and no practical limitation, just Linux fanboy FUD -- 
especially as NTFS uses Unicode, so special characters don't 
take many bytes as with UTF-8.

&gt;<i> And worst of all: it lacks a package-management.
</I>
Worst of all: Linux has fragmented centralised package 
management. All the gazillion distributions doing redundant
work have de facto central control over what software you 
can easily install on that particular distribution.

On Windows I can just download software from the ISV, and 
easily run it. In a sandbox if I want to. And, best of all,
nearly all the latest sofware still runs on Windows XP, which
is from 2001 (and largely still uninfected by the current 
blur-fascist IT regime). Try running latest Linux binaries
-- or even source, for that matter -- on Linux from 2001. 
FAIL.

It's sick. Linux is outright against independent software 
vendors, and yet it's Microsoft that gets sued for any 
feature they add to their OS.
