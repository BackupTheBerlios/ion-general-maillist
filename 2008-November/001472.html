&gt;<i> One should be able to get into The Zone for an extended period to properly
</I>&gt;<i> get going with a new project
</I>
Which The Zone?! ... the only one I *know* is those of a marvelous, fabulous
movie, Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker (I would now, that I am recalling it, put
Stalker in the best three movies I have seen ever). There is also the book,
Stalker.

Funny, you have an alter ego in Switzerland (and vice versa): a gifted
mathematician (I have been told professor Henrici, a renown mathematician and
absolutely not an easy man by reputation, has asked him, in vain, to become
his assistant), a genial programmer for sure ... the best one I have met and
have worked with a couple of years.

You are talking, reasoning, and are productive (very productive), exactly
the same way (and vice versa).

In fact, these off-topics are recalling me discussions--intellectually very
productive *collateral thinking*--at the cafeteria.
