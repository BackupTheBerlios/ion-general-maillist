<PRE>I chose Digest mode.
Not sure how to directly reply to Nick's post. So this is a new  
message with copy and pasted subject.
There's no nesting involved is there?

Anyway:

 &gt;You have to wait for a second for the menu to appear, which is time- 
wastey.

Not really, maybe i should have just said 'click' instead of 'press  
and release'.
All I really want is to do a single right-click on the tab, to open  
the context menu and REMAIN open WITHOUT having my finger down on the  
mouse button. Like how other mainstream desktop environments deal with  
menus.
Until you click elsewhere, the menu will disappear.

I'm proposing this as a dell laptop user with a two button trackpad. I  
use two finger tap as right-click.

Don't you think it is a tad annoying to have your finger down on the  
button at all times while choosing something from a menu? No matter  
whether you use a trackpad, mouse, laptop, desktop.

Of course the keyboard is always a faster solution, and that's the  
point of ion3 isn't it?
However, I think within an environment such as ion3, the mouse/ 
trackpad has potential to work much better than any 'modern' desktop  
environments.

Thanks,
Robin
