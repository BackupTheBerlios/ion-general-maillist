Objective correctness is fiction. All that matters is what I think.

I'm not going to waste time serving the fancies of the FOSS herd,
especially ones that I have no use for, when all it tries to do 
is make my life more difficult and laboursome.

Maybe, but it can be something as simple as a bicycle model that 
suits your style, and such small differences have quite insignificant 
environmental impact, on a vehicle that runs on your own power and
demands little space. (Recumbent tricycles can demand quite a bit of 
space, though. It could also be argued that aluminium frames should 
be used less than they presently are, in favour of heavier steel 
frames that only tend to be used on very basic and el cheapo bicycles
anymore. I'm not sure if such out-of-the-sight construction materials
fall into the penis enlargement department, though.)

&gt;&gt;<i> assuming you agree that people need to move around faster and

</I>&gt;<i> Is it still practical to ride a bike below -10C in winter considering

</I>
-10C is nothing. -20C is still quite tolerable. In -30C breathing
has become quite difficult, but it's still doable. (Some cheapo
components designed for warmer climates don't seem to like it much:
I broke one crankarm in such temperatures just by standing on the 
pedal. Derailleurs also start to freeze, when you have to leave the
bike outside for the day.) Walking starts to become more convenient
below -20C, though, as it demands more warming motion than cycling, 
and has less chance of making you breathless.

I'd actually like to try skiing for commuting in the winter -- it's 
faster than walking, and also demands more warming exercise than 
cycling -- but the vehicles of terror (cars) having consumed most
of the space, with all the rest being squeezed on narrow gritted
multi-use paths that frequently intersect the largely dry asphalted
domain of these infernal machines, it's not possible.
