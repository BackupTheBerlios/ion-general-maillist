People read manual pages? Those people that install Ion from a distro
without checking whether it is obsolete?

&gt;<i> that &quot;informational&quot; window that you get first time you run ion really

Bah, the distros conduct is the problem, so they should fix it.

And besides, then I'd have to forbid the distros from removing that -- 
and again they would moan that &quot;it's not free&quot;. (The FSF is actually 
among the saner end of the FOSS movement, what with GFDL including 
invariant sections, and GPLv3 containing provisions for requiring 
modified versions to be renamed or so. The real zealots are centered
around the distros, and only consider those licenses &quot;free&quot; that give
distros the most power at the expense of authors.)

It's funny, actually: FOSS is supposed to be developed in a bazaar, 
but the typical FOSS licenses are only suited for cathedral mode of 
development: release when it is ready and stable as a rock. For 
otherwise you'll have to suffer from distros distributing obsolete
development snapshots.

&gt;<i> So anyone who doesn't spend all their time recompiling software for what  
</I>&gt;<i> is, for most people, a tool and nothing more, is an idiot according to you.
</I>
These are not end-users with other specialities, but rather the lower
strata of developers.

&gt;<i> Well, I almost exclusively use binary packages - because they make my life  
</I>&gt;<i> easier.  
</I>
I provide one too -- for a few platforms. Most authors provide them on 
Windows. But generally binary packages for FOSS operating systems are only
available from The Party. 

&gt;<i> You'd rather deal with yourself and only yourself - you've demonstrated  
</I>&gt;<i> this arrogance before, and will do again.  
</I>
I've had enough of the FOSS herd, and how it's destroying everything I
once thought could be great. I really am universes distant from them. 

&gt;<i> It's a shame that I don't have  
</I>&gt;<i> the time to write a tiling WM myself, because I actually think that a  
</I>&gt;<i> couple of us here could do a very good job of it.
</I>
Yep, the typical FOSS attitude: write a clone for petty reasons of 
ideology, rather than fixing far bigger issues with the shoddy quality
of FOSS crap, the monoculturist practises prevalent in the movement,
ridding yourself of the love of The Party, and so on.
