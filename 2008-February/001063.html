Mostly, yes. Scheduler may need to be in the kernel. Dunno how it
is in existing exokernels, but they do not e.g. include message-
passing as microkernels too. That's handled by user side through
the kernel-provided memory management. File systems are obviously
in user space.. and programs can simply directly allocate disk
pages from the kernel, if they don't care to use a file system 
service. (Over reboots they somehow have to remember their
root pages, however. This is actually related to the orthogonal
persistence of EROS.)

</I>
Actually, I see the lightweight exokernel as a somewhat of a 
return to the golden age of DOS. Device drivers can be abstracted
as libraries too, when the device doesn't have to be shared, and
any program can use the library. The kernel just takes care that 
no two processes use the device's memory space simultaneously. 
Now, obviously a sound server that mixes multiple streams is a 
useful one, as is a display multiplexer, but you don't particularly
need a specific low-level driver service, but rather drivers within
such much higher level services. Basically a bit like the X server
presently is actually, but hopefully without its reliability 
problems.. (also to consider how to do DRI shit nicely while not
giving any bloated and unreliable program full control of such 
a critical resource).
