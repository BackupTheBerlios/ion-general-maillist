</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; First, thanks for starting this thread! I did notice that Tuomov's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; pages were down, but since his whole site was down, I was waiting 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; for it to come back without realizing he might have taken the whole 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; project down.  Quick question: do we know for sure Tuomov has 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; severed connections with ion3 permanently or is this our best guess 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; at this point?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It's a pretty solid guess...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tuomo responded to an email on this list on March 22.  Maybe he's just 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on vacation.   He's complained often about the lack of good, simple web 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hosting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tuomo's website 404'd, the rest of the (host) website and all the other
</I>&gt;<i> accounts look pretty fine to me, doesn't seem like a problem with the
</I>&gt;<i> host at all (although it's still possible).
</I>
Bad choice of words on my part: by 'web hosting', I didn't mean the 
server -- I meant the software, e.g.:

<A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/ion-general@lists.berlios.de/msg03126.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/ion-general@lists.berlios.de/msg03126.html</A>
Ikiwiki replacement etc. - Tuomo Valkonen
&quot;&quot;&quot;
I will have to replace Ikiwiki as the Ion site generator, since it fails 
to work under Cygwin. [...]
&quot;&quot;&quot;


&gt;<i> &gt;  Seems slightly hasty to not wait to hear from the man himself that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  the project is &quot;abandoned&quot;-abandoned (as opposed to &quot;I've switched 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  to Windows, and don't plan to support this&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i believe forking was already on a lot of people's minds for some time 
</I>&gt;<i> now (as somebody else mentioned), the fact that the website is no 
</I>&gt;<i> longer available merely served as a motivation.
</I>
Yep.  Seems reasonable, despite Fake Tuomo's proclamations (ha).


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; ion3 has been my primary environment for a while now, and I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; won't consider changing. I love its design, philosophy, and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; simplicity, but I'm preaching to the choir here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm all for forking into /one/ fork, and that too only because 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; of the licensing issue--please lets not make multiple messy 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; forks. Like a few of you, I don't have much time either right 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; now, but expect to be able to contribute a more a few months 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; down the line. But I can contribute towards getting us going 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; right now if needed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Personally, I don't understand everyone's reluctance to even 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consider changing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> not true, i suggest you dig deeper into this thread...
</I>
You're right of course.  s/everyone's/some people's/


&gt;<i> &gt; Ion's great 'n all, but without extremely committed 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leadership, there doesn't seem to be much point to forking.  (Either it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will remain the useful tool it is and only get bugfixes, or it'll bitrot 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; completely.)  Why not branch out and get other similar-minded window 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; managers (under active development) to incorporate some of what you love 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about ion?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> now why didn't 'we' think of that?
</I>
Not sure if that's sarcastic.  Doesn't make sense if it is.  My point 
was that moving on might be more fruitful than treading water.


&gt;<i> i believe anybody who could have left has already done so. so...
</I>
Touch&#233;.

Guess I'll go back to lurking.  (I'm only still here for the occasional 
Tuomo rant.)


&gt;<i> &gt; Guessing that won't be a popular sentiment, but whatever.  Not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trying to completely discourage anyone -- just adding my $.02.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> we're ion users, we are used to unpopular sentiments; we should get a 
</I>&gt;<i> prise or something.
</I>
Also a good point.

As before, best of luck.
