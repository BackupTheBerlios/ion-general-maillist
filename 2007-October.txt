Hi all!


Some week ago i read about ION window-manager at the Hungarian Unix 
Portal. Due, I'm an engineering monkey, and i really hates wasting my time playing with the windows locations, i 
thought the tiling wm would be a good thing for me. So, i pulled down the ION2 from the Debian respository and give 
it a shot. 
My first thoughts: Simple, efficient and fast.
After that, i dowloaded the ION3 source, and compiled it. Well, it's a 
bit different from the Debian's ION2, but the development is clear. The Run menu file listing is damned fast 
comapared to the GTK+ same function.
I'm still testing it, but i can't find any bug, yet.
Also i have some ideas and thoughts, which i compiled to kind of 
whistlist. Most is not a basic wm feature, but it would be nice in a tabbed, tiling wm. Maybe some of these already 
developed, but spending 13 hours with the soldering iron, and 3 hours moving bricks every day, leaves me a small 
time to reading the documentations.

Requested features:

Policy settings for the new window creation. When i run some multyple 
window application (mplayer, gimp), it would be nice if i could set where must the spawned window must to be 
placed. Currently it's follows the mouse pointer. My idea is to be set a policy for every application (tabs) for 
the method of the new window placement.
Three or four rules (same tile, some tile, any tile, float) would be 
suffice.

Auto size adjust for the fixed size applications at start. If i run some 
application like gkrellm, xmms, it would be nice, if the tile size automatically set, when it's start.

Switching the application to full screen mode, and back to the previous 
tile settings. Some applications like the IDEs, database managers, CADs 
requires full screen and split screen mode in the working process (for 
example: routing the PCB with the layout editor and checking the 
schematic at the same time. Usually it's a constant switching between 
the "splited" [picking and placing a part] and fullscreen mode [routing 
the part's net]) 

Mouse aided tile resize.


User experiences:
These are some ideas for applications, which increasing the user base of 
the ION. I know, these are not necessary for a successfull wm, but 
usually these tools, which is mostly affect the user feels.

GUI based configuration tool for the keybindings.

Support for alternate keybindings. The basic ION keybindings is disaster 
using with Midnight Commander or Gentoo file managers. Both of these 
heavily depends on the funtion keys. Also the most CADs heavily depends 
on the function keys.

Icon based, floating style application launcher.

Happy hacking!

This is done using winprops in cfg_kludges.lua.
I think the main distribution includes some kludges samples.

Tuomo thinks this is brain damaged. If he were even to develop that,
what should happen when many apps will try to set their own fixed size
? One cannot decide.
Then, what will happen to your desktop when even a single fixed size
app will come and mess everything up ?

My policy about fixed size apps is preparing the layout for them then
using winprops to make them stick into their allowed space.

This already exists, grep fullscreen in your cfg_bindings.lua.

This already exists.

I don't think there are many users out there still using the default
keybindings.
This encourages people to look at cfg_bindings.lua and make their own,
which is IMHO an excellent policy.

There might be some apps doing that but that doesn't sound like ion's
business to me.

Sorry if my advice seems outdated, I've been Windows-imprisoned for a long time.

As mentioned in another post, I'm unlikely to be writing any new stuff 
for Ion in the next handful of years, if ever. It's time for something
else, and GNU/Linux (and consequently *BSD as well to a slightly lesser
extent) is turning into such a clusterfuck idiot box, that I doubt 
there's anything semi-usable to run Ion on after I'm ready to start
working on Ion4... aside from maybe Windows. Nevertheless, I'm likely
to put up an 'Ion3plus' repository after the stable Ion3 is released,
where users can contribute code moderated/edited by me, the malevolent
dictator -- or rather, editor. (A project with an editor that does his
job is like a journal with a good editor, whereas a truly bazaarian 
software project is like writings on the toilet wall -- or the typical
wiki.)

This is something of a FAQ. You can set somewhat rigid policies by the
winprops mechanism, as indicated in another post. I'd like the default
to be to place the windows in the frame they were created from, but
this requires application support. It should be doable by writing a
support module for the (typically ultra-complicated) FDO startup spec,
which I couldn't be arsed to do, but few applications that matter
actually support it. So in lack of that, placing windows in the
current window is the policy of least surprise.

Maybe you can write a script to do so. I don't like it. Ion-friendly
applications should behave as if they were full-screen (single-document)
programs, adjusting to the size of their virtual screen -- the Ion frame.
For some smaller monitor sort of applications I did once think of writing
a support for so-called trays (nothing to do with the tiny system tray icons),
but couldn't be arsed.

You can resize with the rat.

It's configurable.

Yuck. Well, for a touch screen kiosk sort of thing, a sort of sidebar
application launcher could be nice...

At least there's _still_ that choice to the OSDL-sponsored hegemony.
(I'm beginning to think OSDL and its member companies are more harmful

Provided you bear with monoculture and software locks, why not.

Many languages themselves aren't that bad (Nemerle is another interesting 
DotNet language), but the libraries and library frameworks around them, 
designed by inferior minds, tend to suffer from megalomaniac hierarchies
(Haskell is another example) as well as OO fetish these days.

Is it a sardonic, or a "WC graffiti"-style (to borrow from your
post) :) like answer? If yes, then you can stop reading, false
alarm.

Icon stuffed sidebars/menus can be seen with Fluxbox, the window
manager. (Fluxbox which now has even ... *rounded menu corners*.)
Is that what you mean?

The point: Fluxbox illustrates well how a passable
[retrospectively observing] window manager originally, Blackbox,
has been transformed into a pig:

500K for Blackbox [stripped], versus 1,2-1.3M [stripped] or
more for Fluxbox, I don't remember ... I don't use Fluxbox,
have merely tried it for a couple of day. (And never mind the
UNAVOIDABLE errors [discover how many of these a guy such Wietse
Venema admits he is still making when he programs with maximal
care]--a percent of them involving security of course--per, say,
every thousand lines of code that constitute a program ... don't
forget that things do NOT worsen linearly, by surplus.)

Fluxbox adds zero, or little, SIGNIFICANT features compared
to Blackbox: *post factum* window tabbing can be functionally
included/simulated more intelligently via mrxvt, an rxvt based
terminal emulator. (mrxvt, 184K [stripped], adds the only good
thing Fluxbox has and Blackbox doesn't: tabbing.)

Said that, window managers such Ion or wmii are the ones
to go eventually--and the sooner the better.

Icons, a dozen or two ones [airports, restaurants, etc.]
excepted, truly belong to the *creme* of the crap--sugar
candies--that has delayed developing in depth and re-discovering
a much more intelligent way to interact with programs in general
by keeping people attracted to it. No icons please.

Cheers,

Not really. Not everyone is up to the task of designing a programming
language, and certainly not a beautiful and useful one (certainly not
the C++ designers!), whereas it is comparatively easy to write a
crappy library up to a specification of what it must provide access 
to. Designing a beautiful library -- now that takes effort again.

I'm not saying unsuitable, I'm saying they suck aesthetically.

Good programming is art, science, and engineering. In present
practise the engineering -- i.e. ugly kludges to get things
working now, fast -- aspect is dominant almost to the exclusion
of the two others.

As I already said, the language itself (well, Haskell'98 anyway 
-- the extensions are rather crummy) is rather nice, but the 
libraries suffer from YAMMBHE.

C doesn't need organisation... Now, namespaces would be nice, but
I don't think they should form a global rigid hierarchy that will
run without central bureaucratic control into conflicts just like 
a global (non-cryptographic) flat namespace. I think libraries 
should be imported locally in a given namespace. You know, like
Haskell already lets you import libraries from the Huge Hierarchy
locally in modules with a different name

    import qualified Some.Deeply.Nested.Crummy.Shit as S

with Some.Deeply.Nested.Crummy.Shit actually provided by
'-package foobar' on the command line, when it isn't part
of the standard MegaCollection. So why not have various
small libraries living in the operating system's namespace
(the file system) and import them locally with some name,
using the file name directly (instead of the compiler system,
like GHC, having a crummy wheel-reinventing database for its
own packages)

    -package S=/pkg/libfoobar-1/lib/libfoobar.so

(Then further combine this with the cryptographic namespace
of a package capability system [1].)

No, it's semi-serious. But I guess this kind of stuff doesn't
really belong in the WM itself. And, indeed, now with the some
improvements I made to the status display stuff, you could run
some panel application to do. But you'd probably want some WM
interaction protocols to actually switch to a running program
and so on.

There actually was some interesting attempt to create a very
kiosky WM, but it's been abandoned, and I can't remember its
name.

Icons aren't that bad for some applications and touch screens.
Just like the acme/p9 mouse-heavy interface is just utter and 
total crap on vertical-screen-and-horizontal-controls tabletop
computers, it might actually work quite nicely on touch screen
tablets. The mouse is to a touch screen what a pantograph is
to a pencil!

There is also a Debian package of Ion3 (which I maintain) but due to
Tuomo's trademark policy it is in the non-free section so you will have
to add that to your APT sources to see it.

And at: http://www.niallmoody.com/twindy/screenshots.htm there
are screenshots to be seen.

Twindy may, or may not ... I ignore, be good. On the other hand,
the screenshots show without pity icons whose substance grade and
themes range from authentic *Art Brut*^1 to kindergarten.

Let's see: hammers, screwdrivers, spanners as they would come
directly from Brio or Meccano of the children; magnifying lens,
scissors, envelopes and folders from the kids' Little Postal
Store; houses, pencils and colorful arrows--to the left, the
right, up, down, cycle--from the game of the goose or the books
of the Brothers Grimm; and so on.

Incidentally, and to get an idea of the *gravity* the situation:
compare with ... Egypt and Greece, say, of the past. (Who has
visited Pompeii, the ruins, near Naples once, at the limit?
Notice that Pompeii has even been a kind of Club Meditarranee of
the past, NOT a *cradle* of civilization for sure!)

Were they not--ironically--more *artistically advanced* [read:
provided with a more vivid imagination] still than ... hem,
*we* anno 2007? (Hello *Teddy* [Adorno], who once called our
*modern history* [cultural] *progressing* rather a regression
into pre-agrarian times.)

Guess what?! icons are a bit limited--or then are completely
arbitrary--as a medium and language to be used in defining and
describing tasks to be accomplished through a *fantasy*- [sigh]
less automaton and computer. They are wrong metaphors--actually a
kind of aphasia, or incapability to speak and explain--as much as
*cute* and *charming* [sigh] they may appear.

Cheers,

PS

Icons--not convinced yet? Put a look at a last Fluxbox *theme*.
Who knows, you may discover Cinderella, or Hansel and Gretel
*fashioned* icons stuffed in menus [with rounded corners!] in
a Postmodern, or ... what else?, Hyperrealist atmosphere and
*ambiente*. Or also: Mattel [Barbie, the doll] on Giger^2 ...
chacun a son gout, isn't it?


     1. Art Brut. [T]he idea of "Art Brut" appeared around 1945.
Its conception is generally attributed to the French painter Jean
Dubuffet who meant by the term "works executed by those immune to
artistic culture in which imitation has no role; in which their
creators take all (subjects, materials, transposition, rhythm,
style etc.) from their own individuality and not from the base
of classical art or stylish trends". One can understand from
this definition that practitioners of "Art Brut" are mentally or
socially marginal: prisoners, patients of psychiatric hospitals
or other institutions, originals, solitary beings, condemned, all
individuals who have a social status removed from the constraints
of cultural conditioning.

     2. Hans Ruedi Giger. [G]iger got his start with small
ink drawings before progressing to oil paintings. For most
of his career, Giger has worked predominantly in airbrush,
creating monochromatic canvasses depicting surreal, nightmarish
dream-scapes.

     [H]is most distinctive stylistic innovation is that of
a representation of human bodies and machines in a cold,
interconnected relationship, described as "biomechanical". His
paintings often display fetishistic sexual imagery and are
considered disturbing by some.

     Giger is also the guy known by most people because of
Alien's, the movie, designs for sure.

Umm... even cave-men must have had more vidid art and architecture
than that of the more general chronic form of arrogance known as 
modernism. As for more post-modern stuff, it takes taste, which 
few have. Banalities are easy.

Icons are very limited in their expressive power, and therefore
they only work when there are just a few of them, that can be
easily distinguished. But the typical WIMPshit application has
tens of tiny ones lined up in a toolbar.

<snip>

I use a mostly stock set of bindings. The bindings I did change were
mostly to move them to MOD4, a couple to add bindings for some scripts I
use/wrote, and a couple to make the edln bindings a little more
emacs/readline friendly.

Copying the default cfg_bindings.lua file into ~/.ion3 and then attempting
to customize it is not a good idea, it creates upgrade problems (which I
will grant you matters less and less as ion3 approaches stable) and
requires more effort to deal with in general than the much easier option
of just creating and overriding any bindings you actually want to change
in cfg_ion.lua (or in any other file in ~/.ion3 that you then dopath()
from cfg_ion.lua).

As to the gui config tool idea, there was a mailing list thread a little
while ago about creating a simplified binding format for ion3 and after
which I worked on a script for just such a thing, you can find it in the
scripts repository, that's not quite a config gui but it should be much
easier for an 'average' person to deal with than the lua config files (or
so was the theory of the people in the mailing list thread).

What do you mean here exactly? Just a launcher that uses icons? There are
any number of applications that give you a bar of icons that can be
customized to launch applications of your choice, in general I've found
them less than helpful, annoying to keep configured with the applications
I'm really using, and not significantly faster than a Run: dialog (mod1-F3
in the default bindings).

Is there a specific type of launcher you are thinking about? Random
floating icons? A toolbar full of icons? Something else? Is there
something specific you want to launch with that? Would a popup or query
menu of the specific applications work the same for you?

One possibility for a "floating" launcher could be to run some kind of file 
manager in the scratchpad. The annoying part is that you'd have to be quick 
to close the scratchpad for the program to not end up there, or write some
scripts to kludge around this.

Another possibility would be to run a suitable dockapp (there probably
exist suitable ones; see dockapps.org), either in the floating dock, or
simply in the statusbar, not floating. If the latter suffices, you might
also want to check a thread from some months back started regarding the
RoX panel.

Nice would be somethings like *tools* ... as in Oberon^1.

Reference is: The Oberon System^2

     [C]ommands are entered into a text *viewer* and then
     executed with the mouse. It is therefore quite natural to
     prepare a set of frequently used commands in a text which is
     stored on disk. Such a text is called a *tool*. [Commands
     may be embedded anywhere in a text.]

     [W]hen displayed, a tool is quite similar to a menu. A set
     of commands is listed and the user simply executes them
     with the mouse. However, if the commands request parameter
     input, there is no need for complex (modal) input or dialog
     boxes. We deal with an editable text and the parameter can
     be easily entered, thus recovering the flexibility of the
     'remember and type' environment.

     [T]he [Oberon] screen is tiled in non-overlapping windows
     termed *viewers*. Viewers are stacked in two piles called
     *tracks*. Each viewer displays a document being processed by
     the users. Documents may be texts, graphics or pictures.

     [W]hile the display shown appears familiar there is a
     fundamental difference of deep significance: *the modality
     of texts has been abolished*. What looks like menus in the
     title bars of the viewers is text too, no different from the
     editable text of the main viewer area.

     [I]f a command produces output to the screen, a new text
     viewer is opened with the command's output text. Again,
     this text may be edited, stored or printed. Oberon commands
     produce *non-volatile* output.

     [A] user, looking at the screen of a typical computer
     terminal or personal computer, sees, most of the time, lines
     of text. He or she has mastered the concept of the cursor, a
     point where text can be entered or deleted.

     [H]owever, the user will quickly learn that text is not
     text. It is *volatile* text in the sense that it cannot
     be saved, printed or edited. Text can only be entered in
     the bottom line in which case it is a command. This user
     has discovered that text is *modal*: it is either a system
     message or editable text or a command.

     [L]ater generations of software introduced menus: commands
     are displayed in lists, ready for execution by pointing.
     However, menus are distinct from editable texts. If a menu
     command requests parameters, a so-called dialog box is
     opened. A new mode is entered. The user must complete the
     box before he or she is allowed to continue.

     [T]he Oberon user interface departs radically from the
     standard models. The concepts of the command line and of
     menus are absent. Instead, there is simply one kind of text
     which behaves as an intelligent person not yet spoiled
     by so-called 'computer-literacy' would expect: it can be
     changed, edited, printed and stored. "Text is a text,
     nothing more, nothing less."


Okay, and how does a typical Oberon display look?

This is the Acme/P9 interface that I referred to in another post, 
and it's just utter and total crap on a typical horizontal-controls-
and-vertical-screen computer, but might be usable on a touch screen
tablet. The "marketing" for this kind of interfaces is from the 
pre-tab-completion era! From the pre-historical era! (Pun intended.)
I've hit a command query key, typed a couple of letters of the 
command and hit <tab> faster than moving the hand to the mouse! 
Not to even speak of pixel-hunting text with the pantograph that
the mouse is.

"utter and total crap," hmm. Bah, I will let it to you.

A VERY knowledgeable guy (you certainly knows who he is) has
(among other things) designed a VERY nice programming language:
Eiffel. Unfortunately, he would--and does, indeed--call "utter
and total crap" everything is not Eiffel.

What to say? "Teddy" [Adorno] tells that every and each
masterpiece is the *mortal* enemy of the other one. Who knows.
Alternatively, an university assistant, a fellow among the very
few really good programmers [a mathematician by education, of
course] I have met, has remarked once at a cafeteria with the
*scherzoso ma non troppo* tone which distinguishes cafeterias'
conversations: --Uuuh, Bertrand is of the kind of geniuses which
should get a ... mouse :) plugged somewhere: click-click, "help,
I have this specific problem/don't understand that, please
explain"; and when he finishes, and begins speaking of other
things: "another time, thank you Bertrand," click-click--.

:)

Maybe, but do you know The Hare and the Hedgehog tale by the
Brothers Grimm? (Beware.)

Besides: no one is saying that you couldn't longer type tabs, why
make it an aut aut?

Look in a dictionary: agoraphobia. What do you have against

That's the way it's been in these implementations: you _have_ to use
the rodent and heavily. As such, having a buffer to store commands
(one per line) into doesn't sound that bad, but the actual interface
to use those commands (on the typical computer with controls separate
from display) -- it should be a command query that searches for matching
lines or so. But these people want you to paint the text with the rat,
which is a very cumbersome task.

What's agoraphobia got to do with mice? 

Computer mice simply are terrible devices not suited at all to
the vast majority of the tasks people want you to use them for.

Disagree. (The number #1 accessory I buy with a notebook is
a mouse, to let us understand. Alphabet Morse tipping on the
touchpad--and which becomes hot [cpu: 59 C, sda: 40 C, don't know

You can disagree, but there is a lot of research that quantifies
problems with mice and how they're used.  I recommend "The Humane
Interface" as reference material; key points include

  * context switching between keyboard and mouse is worse than using
    either alone

  * Fitt's Law (and all of the other things we *know* about humans
    using visual interfaces) and how so many interfaces ignore it

  * the only really solid occupation use study of repetitive stress
    injuries found that it was *mouse and keyboard* use, not keyboard
    use alone, that was a good predictor of medical problems...

It's a mechanical device for changing the size of a drawing or so 
by moving one pointer on a source image and another with a pencil 
on a target paper. Obviously, especially if the linkages are
a bit worn down, it's rather cumbersome to point to a specific point 
in the target by moving just the source pointer. But this is the 
operation of the mouse.

Not sure, I suspect you have lost *focus* a bit. I have
mentioned: TOOLS. (Re-read the thread, perhaps.)

    > context switching between keyboard and mouse is worse than
    > using either alone

Thank you very much. But let us not start measuring the
microvolts over a noise in the order of the volts.

Example: better to go from, say, Helsinki to Zurich via the
railway--don't take an airplane!

I can't tell for Finland. (Incidentally, Finns seem to be,
willingly or not, I ignore, those *fools* who are *testing* the
snake-oil/baloney thing with the *bio*- [sigh] fuel: *thank you*
from the countries such Indonesia, who will then take the bait,
pay your bill eventually [see below also], and keep stuck in more
shit for the next decades.)

But for Switzerland I know. Kloten [Zurich's main airport] is
30 km from the center of the city, while the *Hauptbahnhof*,
the main station of the railway, is situated--surprise--in the
center directly.

If you are going to Zurich from Finland, and take the train, you
will spare you a *context switch* [Kloten-Zurich] at the least.
(Maybe even two, depending from Helsinki.)

QED, and end of example.

     > Fitt's Law (and all of the other things we *know* about
     > humans using visual interfaces) and how so many interfaces
     > ignore it

I am *lucky* (like most people too, well): I am right-handed!

Would I have been left-handed instead, I would not--I mean, not
with this notebook I am using right now and like VERY MUCH--be
able to keep the mouse 10-15 cm on the right of the keyboard.

Hence, I can touch with the right little finger the mouse from
the keyboard most of the time, with not much a greater effort
than when I reach with the left little finger the escape-taste
on the top-left of the keyboard. (I don't have hands a' la
basketball player, just in case.)

As a left-handed I would [I am imagining] need as minimum to keep
the mouse at a diagonal [> 10-15 cm ... Pythagoras simplified:
a**2 + b**2 = c**2] from the keyboard: on the left of the
notebook there is [not at all a bad idea] the fan's exhaust--hot
air is blown out.

And as left-handed, I would also not be able to plug a notebook
LEDs' lamp in the USB port [the notebook thankfully has a total
of four USB ports] on the left ... notebook lamp which, beyond
increasing contrast [blueish light] on the keyboard, also
warranties that I can't pull/shift inadvertently. a, say, book
immediately in the front of the exhaust, obstructing it.

Then; I have *invested* a bit, I have bought a Logitech mouse [I
am Swiss, but have no relations with with Logitech]. Logitech is
not the cheapest in general. On the other hand, Logitech knows
well how to design GOOD mice. (With time, I am even planing
to take more fun with the mice: a battery status indicator to
display on the screen [I have seen a project for a Logitech mouse
already]; and a wheel who responds ... for now I can live without
these, and have other priorities.)

But I am digressing. Back to the point.

Sorry, and with all respect speaking: to which users of an
*interface* are you thinking: to hemi- or paraplegic ones?

I use a vi-like editor EVERYWHERE I can. And don't hesitate to
grasp the mouse EVERY TIME it makes sense--which it happens
often enough. The mouse sustains/complements well vi, I have not
noticed *problems*.

Have you ever seen "Teddy's" [Adorno's], or, even better,
Karl Marx's pictures of handwritten notes and originals? (I
have hold on my hands a [mechanical] typing-machine written
page by Max Frisch, typed *en vitesse* [read: average] speed:
it had two-three ball-pen made amendments only.) Guess, you
would hardly seek for *millions* of corrections and retouches
[context-switches] in these documents.

And how do you edit: hiccup-, or saccadic style?

I am too extreme? Not sure. Dijkstra^1 tells: --"Besides
mathematical inclination, an exceptionally good mastery of
one's native tongue is the most vital asset of a competent
programmer."-- And he is quite likely right. (Actually, there are
two pleonasms, I believe, in Dijkstra's sentence, but never mind;
moreover, and just in case, my own *native tongue* is Italian.)

Moral: don't worry too much on *context-switching*.

    > the only really solid occupation use study of repetitive

Oh please. I live in Indonesia. Spare me the joke of the *stress
injuries* because of the use of the *mouse and the keyboard*.
(Indonesia and ditto for: China, Thailand, India ... have we
reached half of the world population already?) It's like you
were talking of *manicure* in an ICU [intensive care unit] of an
hospital.

What about the hemorrhoids' injuries for those who sit too much,
are mice bad? 8-)

Except Finland is essentially an island in Europe (if it can
even be considered to be part of Europe; in many senses it's
dislocated on the wrong continent). To get by train alone to
central Europe, you'd have to go through somewhere in Russia,
and that's quite cumbersome, probably requiring visas etc.
(And the tracks suck, but incidentally they're now going to
improve the Helsinki-St. Petersburg tracks and byu new faster
trains for it, while at the same time the railroads within
Finland keep rotting, and the same expensive Pendolinos travel
at snail's speed on them. Most of the tracks also have only
a single rail-pair with occasional waiting tracks, so their
capacity is at saturation and can't handle more cargo. And 
yet roads are constantly improved on the excuse of safer 
trucking. Typical Finnish extremely Helsinki-centric petrol
fascist politics.)

The best way to get from Finland to central Europe that doesn't
require using an airplane, is probably an overnight ferry from
Helsinki or Turku to Stockholm, and train from there through 
Denmark to Germany, etc. Ferry to Tallinn would be faster, but
the Baltics don't have decent railroads. Alternatively you take
ferry from Helsinki to Rostock or so, which takes about one and
a half days or so.

Yep, the official religion of this country is transition from
petrol fascism to agro-petrol fascism.

I am right-handed, but I use the rat with my left hand. Why?
Just look at the typical clusterfuck keyboard design. The 
distance to the mouse on the left is much shorter from the
typing position. It's still a chore to reach for the mouse,
however. And despite how crappy the mouse it, nipples, touchpads
and other more easily reached alternatives are far worse than
it otherwise. The touchpad in particular must be forbidden 
technology under some human rights conventions.

The mouse can complement the keyboard, that is _rarely_ the 
case when you are typing or otherwise almost constantly using 
the keyboard with both hands. The mouse best complements the 
keyboards when you can keep one hand on the keyboard and other
on the mouse. This works out quite nicely in e.g. Blender's
interface, and first-person-shooter games.

This claim is probably related to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis,
and it probably is not important that the language one is 
proficient in is even one's native language, just some 
language. Most people, however, are most proficient in their
native language.

I prefer mechanical mice over the optical crap that starts
bouncing the cursor one pixel up and down just by itself
without any device movement. And cordless--no thanks. The
so-called cordless devices actually have _more_ cords than
non-cordless ones, thanks to the gazillion AC adapters etc.
You need to switch batteries and so on, and batteries make
mice heavy. I also don't trust their proprietary encryptions.
(I guess bluetooth has something better, but the other concerns
remain.)

Why such hatred ?
I know that's not a conventional point of view but I'm a great fan of
touchpads and I regard buying mice for laptops as an heresy.

For not-so-precise work you can use one of your thumbs without moving
your hands out of the keyboard and for the rest you have control at
the tip of your finger without the use of a heavy mouse.

You can't even speak of precision pointing -- which most pointing-device
dependent tasks involve -- in the same sentence with the touchpad. And
to make it even semi-tolerable, the surface must be disabled as a button,
as its far too sensitive, and has no response unlike a real button. But 
even after that you feel for long afterwards that you've rubbed your 
fingers against the plastic surface of the touchpad, trying to hit a 
single pixel with a device having the precision of a shotgun. Same 
itchy feeling applies to the nipple too, but in a lesser extend, and 
at least it's quite precise.

Why does the weight of a mouse make you anxious? I use a decent
mouse pad: nylon-tissue over caoutchouc/neoprene; it doesn't
slide below, while on the top, the mouse glides like an ice
hockey *puck* [disk] over ice. (And dirt doesn't get attached
under the mouse.)

The mouse pad is generously sized, maybe 30 x 35 cm, and is 5-7
mm thick--which arranges me very well: I am using a Thermaltake
fan-less notebook cooler pad, thick approximately the same. With
the mouse pad adjacent to the Thermaltake cooler pad, I happily
can open the DVD driver again without the need to push something
below the tray [for offsetting the + 5-7 mm of the notebook
cooler pad] when inserting or removing a disk [for not letting
the tray bend].

I have *normal* sized hands, or, if not, then even slightly
tinier hands than average. And don't like small/lightweight mice
[which I have tried already and know].

Well, I guess that it's problematic at the least to
*ergonomically* design minuscule mice ... how much *playroom*
for ergonomic shaping does it remain with mini-mice? I like to
rest with the palm of the hand over the mouse--try that with
mini-mice--even if it's only for a couple of seconds; I don't
look at the mouse when I size and use it, hence feel comfortable
with /benefit from the slightly increased inertia.

When the scratchpad is open is there a way to get the 'active' frame of
the underlying workspace? If so then writing a script to cause windows not
to open in the scratchpad could easily be written, though getting it to
only not allow that for windows launched from the file manager requires
the fdo startup spec stuff. (A module for which I have started looking
into, for whatever that's worth.)

Yes, but you'd have to duplicate a lot of code in a Lua script. A C
module would have access to region_prepare_manage etc.

On "pantographs," continued:

I am using a Logitech V270 cordless optical mouse for bluetooth.
It weights 323 g [2x AA batteries inclusive!, thank you very
much]. A [manufacturer's description--but agreed:] 1000-dpi
optical sensor offers incredibly smooth, precise tracking for
maximum productivity while traveling [R.L.: and beyond].

The *look* is understatement for its class. Seen from the side,
the V270 has the profile of a cat who is making a hump. And
the nearly flat, tall, left and right sides of the V270 may
disappoint you at first ... in case you were expecting something
*cooler* for your eyes.

In fact, the ergonomics of the Logitech V270 is VERY well
designed.

In another post I have said I believe to have regular sized
hands. Okay, continuing: if I shape my hand like a cup, and lay
it over a desk in pronation [palm under] position, the V270 fills
PERFECTLY the hollow--provided I let the index- and the medium
fingers a bit uplifted ... perhaps like the fangs, or the first
pair of legs, of a funnel-web spider [atrax robustus].

The thumb on one side, and the annular plus the little finger
on the other one, can now SUPERBLY make grip on the--oh
wonder--flat, or nearly so, walls of the V270. While the index
and the annular rest, arranged in a comfortable V-position, over
two generously sized levers/*buttons*, with the wheel in the
middle, and thankfully not interfering ... in case one doesn't,
or can't use the wheel.

Wrist and forearm lay agreeably, if not entirely relaxed, on the
desk, virtually immobile: to let the V270 slide the mm or cm I
need [ca 1 cm to move the cursor from left to right, maybe 8 mm
from top to bottom], I merely flex, or extend, the thumb and the
little finger in general.

Voila', this ... arachnids-like arrangement of the hand--without
the cord there is also little to make the device recall a *mouse*
longer--is perhaps obeying to the .. *gradient* of the optimal
use of the V270. Which I would dare to say is a reasonably
representative contemporary *mouse*.

Kudos to Logitech.

I am using the V270 since a few months, and it is the best
*mouse* I have used ever. (I am not saying that there can't be
better mice around.)

Wirth prefers mice with three buttons. I like ones with two ...
in fact, I regard as not too challenging, from the perspective of
the *motoric* [physiology], to push two buttons contemporaneously
to emulate the third button. On the other hand, I ignore whether
an *instructions statistic*, RISC's like, has been done for the
need/use of buttons in mice: I very seldom need to emulate the
use of the third button. Moreover, I am a *fan* of the Spanish
architect Campo Baeza--a fellow from the *essentialist* movement
[those of the slogan "more with less," in a humorous, more
*positive*/*active* rephrasing/pun of the "less is more" of the
*minimalist*].

About the weight: 323 g of the V270. You would not be able
to make a difference, it's still to little compared with the
total: weight of a loaded notebook bag with or without mouse,
even not with a V270 ... you would not manage to discover if
there is one inside the bag without looking; I guess not even
be able to discriminate *differentially*: one bag in one hand,
another one in the second. 

About the touchpad: I think that it makes sense--for *special
situations* [let's recall that a notebook is more or less
mobile]: mouse doesn't work for any reason, no space to use it,
etc. And as longer it doesn't add significantly to the cost of
the notebook.

Example: Helsinki, January, snow, night. Tuomo has just lowered
the [electric powered] window glass on his side in the car, when
he discovers that, suddenly, he can't longer lift the window
glass--for any any reasons: ice, electric motor problem, etc. A
simple winder would now be VERY welcomed.

Ditto for Roy in [fantasy selection:] Palembang. Just replace snow
with rain [when it rains heavily in Sumatra, it comes down in one
hour as much water than in two-three rainy months in Zurich].


Cheers,

I go with the good old 3-button Pilot. Unfortunately, the left
button of my remaining one is dying, which is another reason
why I'm using it left-handed... The scroll wheel is quite 
cumbersome as a third button, often used for pasting. I 
wonder if there are ones with a proper third button and a
scrollwheel... They'd just have to move (in e.g. the present
Pilot) the scroll wheel a bit towards the centre and add a
third button in front of it.

The high weight makes it heavier to move around, and adds 
requirements for the surface you use it on.

The nipple is preferrable; the touchpad mostly in the way unless
you disable it -- from my limited experience with laptops.

Your example is flawed: Tuomo neither lives in Helsinki nor has or
drives an infernal machine. Tuomo uses highly reliable technology
known as the Oat Engine combined with such a marvel of simple and
reliable engineering known as the bicycle. And against the wind
and snow he goeth.

Apropos; I am using maildir's and maildrop, and need to do the
same with maildrop: some statistics for discovering from whose
mail-lists I receive mails a day the most, so to be able to
better arrange my entries in maildropfilter's maildir (most used
regex first; plus: here, there. or in another place I may spend
some time in trying to optimize).

Does Ion have a facility to start tracing which commands are
executed most frequently ... does it make sense if not? (If you
use your own notebooks/desktops most of the time, or exclusively,
you could perhaps remap more conveniently--depending from the
keyboard's layout--commands.)

It should not be difficult to write a script that wraps 'defbindings'
to add statistic wrappers around the bindings themselves.

Hi,

I tried some hours compiling some panels.
-Ksmoothpanel won't run, crashes.
-pypanel won't find a desktop.name (returning null)

working is:
-kicker
-rox
but: only gnome systray apps, will show up in these panels,
using the mod_dock. Kde apps, will still show up in mod_dock part,
therefore you get these strange padding effects.

using the discussed panel.lua code won't work with kde systray apps
either, they just open up a window with it's icon.

so I'm using a minimalistic kicker at the bottem of screen besides ion
statusbar to let gnome apps register in that. But won't get ion by
defwinprop to register that damn kicker on load as free floating, I've
always to move the kicker window on to the statusbar, so it free floats
instead of fullscreen, any hints?


happy hacking,
jonathan

i wrote a german article on ion3 for the german ubuntu wiki, which will

is there a more elegant way to save your layout than to write-protect

There has never ever been any release of mod_ionflux. It (as well
as mod_xrandr), is available from a darcs repository [1] as it 
always has been. I do not know if it works still: it has also
never been "supported", just something that is available.

How can I switch workspace by name? I've searched in the mailing list

In this there are a few patch and there is a function "bool

very-very old (from year 2001).

So, in Ion3 how can I do it?

Thanks.

That's for Ion1, and the patch doesn't implement that, as you
can see by reading from the description. Ion has always (as far
as I can recall) had named workspace switch bound to F9. Just
type of the name of an existing workspace (with tab-completion
in the middle of the name too), and hit enter. If you type
the name of a non-existent workspace, then you will be asked
to create it, otherwise Ion will switch to the workspace.

If you want to do the same in a script, use ioncore.lookup_region
(possibly filtering by "WGroupWS") followed by WRegion.goto on 
the result (res:goto()).

Subject: ion3 RC packages for Debian etch, and now lenny
Message-ID: <858x5vo4vs.fsf@boum.org>

Hello,

for a few months[1], I?ve been maintaining backports of Debian sid?s
ion3 RC packages for Debian etch.

I updated my build environment a bit, so that I am now in a position
to provide such packages built for Debian lenny (testing) as well :

             http://intrigeri.boum.org/debian/

I update them reasonably quickly when Debian unstable packages are
themselves updated. They are built for i386, and the source packages
are of course available.

As strongly stated on my Debian packages page, these packages are
usually somehow outdated in regard to upstream (pre-)releases : they
are thus not supported upstream, so *please do not report any bug
about these packages to the Ion author*. Really. My Debian packages
page also explains the current RC-nature of ion3.

Message-ID: <985587d00710220929v6c1abae7hf05222acab44fbb8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I want to unsplit (destroy the current frame) and not lose focus
(i.e., to stay in the same window I was before calling the command).
In other words, is there a way to keep the focus in the window from
which I call WTiling.unsplit_at?

Thanks a lot.

Hi all,

I am looking for a simple system monitor to put in the dock. Up to
now, the most convincing application (for me) has been 'conky';
unfortunately, it is too big to fit in a small dock. I don't want
anything fancy; in fact, I would be very happy with a text-based
thing, a sort of ion menu but showing a few lines with some system
variables instead of lists of windows. Does anyone have a hint of how
to do such an apparently simple job?

Thanks a lot. Long life to ion.

It doesn't for me. split keeps the focus, but unsplit_at gives the
focus to the other window.

The other frmae and the frame unsplitted at are fused, destroying
the parameter frame. So from the user POV the focus stays put --
both when the focus is in the parameter frame, and when it is
somewhere else entirely.

Message-ID: <760ece280710231019l5b0aa5e2tb321dfa2ef193645@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I've downloaded and I'm using a program: wmdrawer. Homepage:
http://people.easter-eggs.org/~valos/wmdrawer/
Ok, I know that is a very old program.
So, this program run at startx in three instances: some application,
mpd control and volume control. They are in separate frames. But the
titles are long so it doesn't look fine (see attachment).
Can I rename the titles (e.g. to mpd and volume and apps)?

Thanks!

You can disable the titlebars in those frames entirely if you want to
(rather then just renaming them, which you can also do). To rename them
look into the title shortening rules, to remove the titlebars entirely you
need to switch the frame to the frame-tiled-alt setting (but I can't
recall how to do that offhand, and I'm not in front of ion at the moment,
so hopefully someone will chime in with the right thing.)

This is bad solution because the wmdrawers doesn't load and place its
frame in same order (once the first is mpd, other time the first is
volume, ...). And to its titlebar added a <#> value so the titlebars
are not constants!
The wmdrawer has "can rename instance name"-feature (so I can place it
different frames automatically). Makes it easier the problem?

You can use winprops to match each drawer specifically so that they always
go to the same frame if you want to.

Do the wmdrawers not put a unique value into the title? Can you make them
do that? If you can make them set a unique name (even "wmdrawer - type")
then you can use the title shortening rules. But if need the names to tell
them apart might I suggest having them use different main icons instead?

Also, the shortening rules work just fine with titles that aren't constant
as long as their is a constant bit you want to remove, that's exactly what
they were designed for.

I am sorry, Tuomo, but I don't understand what you mean.
As I (and Matthieu) see it, I am losing focus when I call unsplit_at:
the focus is given to the other window, and I don't want that. I
really don't know if I am missing the precise meaning of 'keeping
focus' or if I have some problem in my configuration file [which
contains the following line
        kpress(META.."W", "WTiling.unsplit_at(_, _sub)"),
]

Thanks for your attention.

<snip>

Now that I'm home the way to turn the tab bars off entirely is to run
_:set_mode("tiled-alt") from the mod1-F3 lua query in the frame you want
to do it in. If that frame is too small you can run "myframe = _" in that
frame and then "myframe:set_mode('tiled-alt')" in a larger frame. And then
repeat for your other frames. And you can run "myframe = nil" when you are
all done for good measure.

Ion these days auto-detaches queries (, menus, and transients) in
small frames. You can also manually de/reattach with Mod1+K D.

You're talking in a confused manner of an entirely different thing than
I am it seems. Yes, the windows from the destroyed frame are just placed
rather randomly in the "rescue" frame, as unsplit seems to use that code
these days. I guess there should be some hack to try to keep the order
too...

My experience is that when splitting a frame the focus remains with the  
application (whichever frame that ends up in).
When merging (unsplitting) frames the application that had focus never  
retains it. The topmost application in the "other" frame is always the one  
to gain focus.

Never been a problem for me - I just make sure I'm on the wrong frame when  
I merge...

Well, that's precisely what I already have. Since I want to hide this
monitor information when I don't need it, I want to be able to toggle
it. I think that the dock is in this respect a more natural choice
than the statusbar. Besides, it allows for a larger display area.

Don't try to convince me that the statusbar is actually quite small
(it is, but that's not the point :).

It's possible to toggle it by writing a script to destroy&recreate.
It is also possible to attach the statusbar to the screen as 
a floating window, so it can be hidden.

mod_dock is in many ways just an inferior version of mod_statusbar.
The few advantages it has, are that it can order the dockapps
vertically, and it has ready code for toggling etc. But mostly
it's actually redundant.

Hello!
Is there any way to make the second statusbar (perhaps one statusbar
at the bottom, and one at the top)?
Or, if I can't make the second statusbar, may be it is possible to
make multi-line statusbar (i think, two lines would be enough)?

I've suggested it to people a zillion times to write multi-line
support into the statusbar. It shouldn't be that difficult, but
I can't be arsed, because the single-line version works for me,
and I have more interesting things to do than waste my time 
writing software for the doomed platform that FOSS/*nix is. With
multi-line support non-destructive toggling could easily also 
be provided by having zero lines. But nothing has happened yet. 

Various other improvements could be made to the statusbar, such
as supporting meters as regions for mouse actions. I've also 
suggested improving the statusd to be a cleaner general-purpose
tool. But I guess nothing will happen wrt. that either. (Ideally
something like DBus could be used -- but not DBus itself because
it's UTF-8 monoculturist [1].)

(Not that anything typically happens wrt. any suggestions,
especially not those related to modular code. People rather
complain about not supporting something or not working like 
they want, and then rather than writing a module, fork or 
write a 95% clone from scratch. And in the end you have 100
highly flawed and unfinished programs that do essentially 
the same thing but with different flaws, instead of a handful
of good programs that do a different thing.)

Ok, today's rant quota is full...

Subject: cycling through frames in tiled layouts (and elsewhere?)
Message-ID: <20071026145259.GB25202@marco.fz-rossendorf.de>

hi,

the question has been raised a few times before seemingly(?)
without a clear solution to it:

is there a lua-function to cycle through  all  frames  (i.e.
it's  currently  visible  client  window)  of a single tiled
workspace, say a 2 x 2 layout?   I  don't   mean   selection
from   some  context menu, but rather something like the be-
haviour of "Mod1+j" in `dwm'.

ioncore.goto_next(..., 'next', ...) is no good for  this  it
seems.

sure, one can _navigate_ with Mod1+Tab, N, P etc. but that's
not the same thing.

so is there a straightforward/easy way to do it?

Works for me, with the frame as the parameter. I don't get why people
want primitive linear cycling, though. Geometric navigation is far 
better as it makes more use of your spatial memory. (Although, the 
situation seems to degrade in 3D -- or 2.5D anyway [1] -- and yet 
the "oooh! shiny!" herd proclaims how 3D interfaces are the future
and will improve usability. My hand-wavy explanation is that our 
visual input is actually 2-dimensional, with any 3D perception the
result of the stereoscopic effect.)

Subject: alignment of 2x2 tilings
Message-ID: <20071026204923.GF12786@kati.fz-rossendorf.de>

a further minor point :

creating a 2x2 workspace by first splitting into two rows and then each
row into two columns nicely aligns the title bars in the lower row,
reducing a bit the size in the lower left window (to account for the
status bar).

splitting first into two columns, than each column into two rows does
not achieve this alignment. I was once told that this is as it should
be, but should it?

I would think the final 2x2 layout should always look the same (and
have aligned title bars). would this really require some "dirty"
fiddling?

Yes. When you first split horizontally, the left frame (in the stock
setup) is smaller than the right one because of the statusbar. Now
when you split both of them vertically into two equal parts, they
can't align. Seeking for another tab to align at would be an ugly
heuristic -- that would likely give you a different result depending
on which frame you split first -- and I don't like heuristics. 
Aligning the splits at some grid coarser than the statusbar might
work more nicely, but what's the point anyway? You can't operate
the frames as if you'd split the other way around in the first
place. I know of no good way around this limitation/feature of 
the Ion and perhaps any tiling model. You could of course write
some dirty heuristics to alter the layout on some resize operations,
but heuristics suck, and so does requiring the user to indicate 
whether they intend to resize a whole column or just one frame 
altering the layout to suit this. If such input is required, you
could just as well call a transpose or such command.

There's also the issue of size hints of the windows in the frames.
Presently (iirc) the size of the new frame is adjusted to the size
hints of the window put there. If you wanted to align tabs, you'd
in have to disable that adjustment, and possibly lose one row in 
a terminal. 

It's not an interesting problem to solve. I rather stick to 
fundamental ideas and problems, not pixel-pushing kludges.

Message-ID: <940ef3c00710272252i77feab0uacb5966f7782cf7b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have recently upgraded from ion-3ds-20060519 to ion-3rc-20070927.
The changes in ion3 internals are massive, and I am in the process of
updating my config files.  The question I am fighting with at the
moment is:

When running GIMP, I create a split for it using the following code:

local ws = top_frame:attach_new({type = "WTiling", dir = "horizontal"})
ws:split_top("right")
fl = ws:split_tree():tl():reg()
fr = ws:split_tree():br():reg()
fl:set_name("GIMP-left")
fr:set_name("GIMP-right")
fl:rqgeom({w = 270})

Later GIMP windows are attached to the split using winprops.  This
worked flawlessly in ion-3ds-20060519, with left side of the split
staying 270px wide all the time, and right side occupying all the
rest.  However, in ion-3rc-20070927 things changed.  When I run GIMP,
the following things happen:

0. Split is created, its left side is exactly 270px wide.
1. GIMP splash screen pops up and goes to the right side of the split,
left side remains at 270px.
2. GIMP splash screen disappears and GIMP toolbox appears, going to
the left side of the split.  The left side gets resized to 450px.
3. I choose File -> New in GIMP menu. A small (much smaller than the
right side of the split) window with new image properties appears and
goes to the right side of the split. Left side gets resized to 220px.

The question is: how can I prevent the split from permanently resizing
itself and make it behave ion-3ds-20060519 way?  I tried putting
rqgeom requests in clientwin_do_manage_alt, but the split keeps
changing.

It is not a question about GIMP, I use a lot of other applications in
similar splits, so this auto-resizing heuristics is a big problem for
me.

Thanks,

Sasha

Hi,

Here is a small bug report (or a feature, depending on your pov):

1. Open gedit.
2. Open Find dialog. A transient window will pop up.
3. Without closing the Find dialog close gedit with File -> Quit.

Now you should have an empty WGroupCW left on the screen.

Regards,

It _might_ happen if you're against better advice using old layout
savefiles. Any backwards compatibility hacks were removed ages ago,
and you will have to start from scratch.

Its not a dream, seriously!  But it looks like I found a reason.  In
my code I, in fact, used:

   fl:attach(cwin, {switchto = t.switchto})

to attach a window to a frame. After changing it to

   cw = fl:attach_new({type = "WGroupCW", switchto = t.switchto})
   cw:attach(cwin, {switchto = t.switchto, bottom = true})

my bad dream is gone!

Thanks a lot for your thought-provoking idea about layouts (which were
brand new anyway), the solution came after looking at my saved layout.

Thanks,

Sasha

Umm... this shouldn't have any effect. Only when you've put a window
in a wrong kind of frame that allows applications to resize it -- as
is the case for floating frames -- could what you describe, happen.
An old layout savefile can cause such type bits to be set.

Also, above you can do:

    fl:attach_new({
        type = "WGroupCW",
        switchto=true,
        managed = { { reg=cwin, bottom = true }, },
    })

or something like that, to get away with a single call.

This is unpredictible (and therefore annoying) sometimes.  How can I
navigate through horizontally splited tiling, where the left half
splitted vertically also?  The result of ioncore.goto_next(_chld,
'direction') depends on pre-previous active frame.

I have seen this problem with unison. If unison shows a fatal
error such as connection lost with server (a transient) the
WGroupCW window is left behind. I have also seen it with another
application but can't remember which right now.

yes, that was essentially what triggered my initial question.

not quite. you cycle through all the frames in a fixed order,
so that - at least for a moderate number of frames in the tiling
it's quite easy to memorize the cycling order.

in contrast, the default navigation via Mod1-Tab, -K-N, -K-P, suffers
indeed from the 'memory effect' w.r.t. to where Mod1-Tab is jumping next.

thankfully tuomo told me (despite his negative rating of cycling)
off-list how to define frame-cycling:

--add this definition to cfg_ioncore.lua:
defbindings("WFrame", {
    kpress(META.."J", "ioncore.goto_next(_, 'next')"),
})
--------------

I've decided to like this approach to augment the usual navigation
facilities, especially in small tilings such as 2 x 2.

Yes, it works fine, thanks!

Best witches,

Hi,

Is there any chance Riot have any update ?

I find it really cool and use it, and would be glad if some few functionality
could be added...( as I can see there are some in the TODO.riot)

Snowball's chance in hell. Seriously, though, I'm _very_ slowly
working on some major changes -- the pace recently seems to have
been about two hours a month -- so it might take a few years for
there to be anything to publish, if ever. In all likelyhood, the
release will be license-free [1] (i.e. The Piratic License applies)
and for Windows, after I've spent a few more years writing a highly
sophisticated terminal emulator for it. Right now, other things
have precedence over coding, however.
