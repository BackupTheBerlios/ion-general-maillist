<PRE>I'll add myself to this list, too.
Thanks for all the work you spend on developing and improving ion3. It
is my favorite Window Manager available. And I've seen a lot, but I
never was quite satisfied with any of them.
It all started years ago with ctwm, then I encountered Enlightenment
(which was at DR12 at this time). I tried *step, FVWM, wmii, larswm,
ratpoison. and I guess some more I've just forgotten.
But I only found in ion3 the freedom of doing exactly what I wanted to
do (not to mention that ion3s default behaviour was nearly what I
wanted.) There was just this one moment when you removed WIonWS and
WPaneWS where I was about to start crying. ;)

So, I hope that this is not the end of ion3, because it certainly is
the most usable Window Manager and it would be a pity if it would
become unavailable/technically unusable eventually.

I can understand that you feel it's time to do something different.
Projects must come to an end eventually, especially when they are done
privately.

I too wish you all the best for your future!
Christian
