&gt;<i> Does someone actually stare at the freshmeat ratings when looking for
</I>&gt;<i> software? Or even use freshmeat?
</I>
I do. I am in Sumatra somewhere, not in an university environment, where I can
ask on the right and on the left, or get help and tips first hand. By the way,
you could also sort searches [default setting inclusive, if you like so and I
am not mistaken] by rating ranking [very rarely used for what it regards me].

I don't read much *nix magazines, nearly zero indeed, so I am following
*transitive closures* of references typically. Then you go to freshmeat.net,
or to freebsd.org often.

When you look for an entry, you get a *window* of other, similar applications,
very often. It's like within a bookshop: you have your list of titles of books
to buy--then you see other books too, which may be interesting. And voila',
one group of cherries hook the next.

Notice that one could also even look for fun at the ratings: e.g., a
phony designation of *proprietary software* for Ion, makes me even more
like the software [good for when I am sometimes mooded with Tuomo ...
kidding--technically you are 1st rate, and in the meantime I have learned
to know Finnish humor a bit] &gt;:)

And no, I am not contradicting myself, unfortunately: I suspect that my
reaction (ditto for most subscribers here on the list, I imagine) is not
average.

I can program a bit--the main deciding criteria remains: personal inspection
of the code [a look over a few sections are enough in general], and of the
documentation.

&gt;<i> (such as slashdot)
</I>
Uuuh, slashdot is even on the [proxy] list of my forbidden URLs, along sites
such BBC and others since years--I don't want to get my day ruined because a
link has me brought there. (There are routine blackouts a bit everywhere in
Indonesia, Bali excepted *of course* ... I am guessing--I never have been,
nor do I count to go there) ... now a bit less because of the Ramadan; I
am economizing with water to wash: if I read slashdot, BBC and similar, I
have then to take a shower. Well, I am exaggerating: the routine blackouts
have started only a couple of months ago. In truth, it's hard then to resist
putting a glance--and wasting time--for 5-10 minutes more getting some cheap
*laughs*, actually it would be more reasonable to cry.)

    { +block }
    ...
    .slashdot.org
    .counterpunch.org
    .cnn.com
    .bbc.co.uk
    .nytimes.com
    .reuters.com
    ...
    { +block-as-image }
    ...

I should sort the entries one day.

&gt;<i> And if someone does really stare at those numbers, maybe that already
</I>&gt;<i> indicates that Ion isn't right for them?
</I>
How to tell?, most don't know of it.
