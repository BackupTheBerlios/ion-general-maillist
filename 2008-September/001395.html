<PRE>Hi,

That line was a rather short-sighted fix to the problem indicated by the
comment - goto_next_scr and goto_prev_scr didn't properly wrap around
with the way mod_xinerama is implemented (i.e. goto_next_scr on the last
screen didn't go to the first screen and the other way around).

The problem is that the root window has its own WScreen object, which
contains the Xinerama screens as children, and whenever we hit that
screen in goto_*_scr, it simply stays where it is.

I though I could just fix it by removing the extra screen for the root
window from the ioncore_g.screens list, but this then causes the crash
on restart, since the destructor for a WScreen object assumes that the
object is in the list.

How would one do this properly? From my analysis of ioncore_goto_*_scr,
it doesn't seem possible to exempt a screen from the iteration list.

They also _seem_ to be intended to do wrapping, but I don't see how this
would ever have worked (but I don't have the old Xinerama code around to
really check). 

The next thing I though of was writing lua wrappers to goto_*_screen
which would just skip the default screen, but it appears that there is
no easy way to distinguish the root window screen from the Xinerama
screens in lua. About the only thing I can think of is that it's the
only screen that can't be found ioncore.find_screen_id(), but that is
starting to feel like too much of a crutch.

ciao,
