<PRE>&gt;<i> And double that in .fi... if it were available. It's
</I>&gt;<i> also still rather big with a 14.1&quot; screen...
</I>
Availability is another story, but don't be fooled by the
14.1&quot; screen mention (&quot;16:10 1280x800 TFT LCD, 200nits,&quot;
it's *larger* than 14.1&quot; might tell at 1st view ...
BenQ, a spin off of Acer, is within #1-#3 in displays
production, you may trust them on the topic).

Put a glance at:


&quot;kaitech.hk - For HK gadget maniacs - BenQ Joybook S73G
Full Review&quot;

[compared are the Sony's SZ, and the LG's TX Express too]


<A HREF="http://www.kaitech.hk/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,71/topic,637.msg3189">http://www.kaitech.hk/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,71/topic,637.msg3189</A>

This is the precise, or nearly identical Joybook model I
own; just that mine has been bought in Jakarta, not in
Hong Kong.


Summary [edited; and no, I have ZERO to do with BenQ]:

PROS:

* Dual Core. Up to 80% faster than the Pentium-M 1.73 GHz
Sonoma

* Very bright 200nits LCD. Beautiful                                        

* Powerful ATi X1600 with 256MB. More powerful than my
desktop's GeForce 6600GT AGP

* 4 USB Ports: 1 on each left/right side. 2 at the back

* Both D-Sub VGA and DVI-D ports available

* Ultra quiet, even when the CPU/GPU are stressed to the
limit

* Internal 5-in-1 card reader now supports 2GB SD Cards.
Previous models cannot

* Inexpensive. PRICE PER PERFORMANCE AND FEATURES ARE OUT
OF THIS WORLD. No competitors! [emphasis mine]

[Roy:] * Bluetooth [up to 9 m range, good for using a
mouse--the optical, Bluetooth Logitech V270 works like a
beauty--and to print]

CONS

* Very hot when playing graphics intensive games.
Definitely not a &quot;laptop&quot; [can't tell, I use a PS2 for
playing games]

* Very warm on the area where you rest your wrist when
typing on the notebook [&quot;very&quot;?!]

* Poor battery life: 2 hours for 3 games, 3 hours for DVD

* No Infrared (its infrared port is for the remote control
only. Nothing else) [don't care, but what about BT?]

* slightly overweight for a 14&quot; notebook [not sure: it's
more thin and wide--which pleases me by the way--maybe
it's that that gives the (false) impression of being
&quot;overweight&quot;].


&gt;<i> Doesn't help when [...]
</I>
The JoyBook [which is intended for my wife and my
first-born daughter] will go up in the morning, when my
wife has placed it on the desk of her office; will go down
on the evening, when my wife will bring it home; then it
will go up again till the morning--with interruptions when
the batteries are running to low. (Everything, minus swap
and an ext2 nosuid,usrquota /tmp, is xfs nonetheless.) And
so on.

&gt;<i> It's a nice place.
</I>
:<i>)
</I>
As it is the corner of the carpet (for wiping dirt under
it) too.

Seriously speaking: I have not tried yet, but given that
a monitor real estate is always scarce, I am thinking to
display some info on the right (vertically) too.

I currently have, e.g.:

    mp: 63 C
    hd: 38 C

horizontally. [I am using an iXoft Thermaltake notebook
fanless cooler by the way]

I am curious to try:

    mp
    63


    hd
    38

vertically [I am continental European, and care little on F in
general]


&gt;<i> I wouldn't want the screen constantly littered with
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>
Neither do I. If one doesn't play with patissier/boulanger
decorations and effects; stays understatement, and thinks
at Antoine de Saint-Exupery from time to time, there is
little danger to litter a screen.


Cheers,


/Roy
