My two posts that haven't shown up....

Any chance you could send them on...

Although there are some programs that are _so_ broken that this is an
advantage.
VNCviewer, for instance, jumps to steal focus (any time the remote
changes size, as it does when you're watching a development machine boot
up), unless it's on a multihead display, in which case it sticks to one
screen (I think it's screen 1 in my setup).

Not that that's any excuse, I really ought to try and fix vnc myself...

John

PS - Have to say I disagree about multihead being a waste of time, even
after reading Tuomo's &quot;Not a blog&quot; entry. I find the additional screen
real estate very useful, and much cheaper to manufacture/buy/run than a
40+&quot; screen ;)

I disagree - I can easily fill my pair of 1280*1024 monitors with active
 frames, the overhead of moving my eyeballs slightly is a whole lot less
than flicking backwards and forwards between workspaces - especially on
older hardware*, which takes a while to paint the screen.

The other advantage is that it's an infinitely flexible document holder
by your workspace - so the document I'm referencing and my workspace, as
well as the results of my code changes can all be displayed comfortably
and easily - alongside the few windows I actively monitor, sat at the
far edge of the screens.

Jumping applications between the screens is a very useful thing to be
ale to do as well, especially if a colleague comes to see what you're
doing, I'd like to be able to move workspaces in their entirety, but
that's evidently not happening any time soon.

John

* My monitors are about 5 years old, and PC about 4.  It doesn't always
crawl, but it does take appreciable time to change workspaces.
