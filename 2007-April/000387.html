Yet further discussions resulted in the following name usage
guidelines/restrictions, that should lie entirely in the
trademark domain, and therefore should also should apply to
how to refer to old releases. (LGPL not touching that domain.)

The code of this project is licensed under the LGPL, version 2.1, unless
otherwise indicated in components taken from elsewhere. It is reproduced 
below. Additionally, the following guidelines/restrictions apply to the 
use of the names Ion, Ion3, and other derived names:

The name 'Ion' refers to the project as a whole, and may not without
further qualifiers be used to refer to any particular version of this
software, or derived work.

The names 'Ion1', 'Ion2', 'Ion3', etc. without further qualifiers refer
to branches of the project. They may not be used to refer to packages 
of versions or derived works that significantly differ from the latest
release on the corresponding branch, as provided by the author, with
a reasonable delay (normally 28 days). Unqualified, they may also not
be used to refer to executables of derived works that significantly 
differ from releases by the author.

The names of particular releases (such as 'ion-3ds-yyyymmdd', with the
last part indicating release date), may not be used to refer to versions
that significantly differ from that release.

Significantly altered versions that are not yet &quot;proper&quot; derived 
works (which would need a new name and maintainer), may use these
names together with a further qualifier that indicates the nature 
of the change, provided that they in no way point to the original 
author for support.

A feature patch to the source code would be considered a &quot;significant&quot;
change. A patch that fixes minor bugs, would a priori be considered
insignificant, especially if it is available from the author. Basic
changes in compiler options and installation paths would obviously
be insignificant. Changes to the configuration files, that merely 
add to the standard version, without obstructing the standard setup, 
would a priori be considered insignificant. Changes to configuration
files that are incompatible with the standard setup, would be 
considered significant. When in doubt, ask.
