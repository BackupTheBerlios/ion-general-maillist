</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First, thanks for starting this thread! I did notice that Tuomov's

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a pretty solid guess...

Tuomo responded to an email on this list on March 22.  Maybe he's just 
on vacation.   He's complained often about the lack of good, simple web 
hosting.  Seems slightly hasty to not wait to hear from the man himself 
that the project is &quot;abandoned&quot;-abandoned (as opposed to &quot;I've switched 
to Windows, and don't plan to support this&quot;).


&gt;<i> &gt; ion3 has been my primary environment for a while now, and I won't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consider changing. I love its design, philosophy, and simplicity, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but I'm preaching to the choir here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm all for forking into /one/ fork, and that too only because of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the licensing issue--please lets not make multiple messy forks. Like 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a few of you, I don't have much time either right now, but expect to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be able to contribute a more a few months down the line. But I can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contribute towards getting us going right now if needed.
</I>
Personally, I don't understand everyone's reluctance to even consider 
changing.  Ion's great 'n all, but without extremely committed 
leadership, there doesn't seem to be much point to forking.  (Either it 
will remain the useful tool it is and only get bugfixes, or it'll bitrot 
completely.)  Why not branch out and get other similar-minded window 
managers (under active development) to incorporate some of what you love 
about ion?

Guessing that won't be a popular sentiment, but whatever.  Not trying to 
completely discourage anyone -- just adding my $.02.


&gt;<i> &quot;notion&quot; seems to get the most support amongst those who posted so 
</I>&gt;<i> far...
</I>
My favorite, too.

Good luck to anyone willing to commit the time it's gonna take.

Best,
Ben
