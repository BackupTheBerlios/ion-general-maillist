<PRE>Perhaps there is a simpler, less radical way you can achieve what you
want.

It seems that you want Ion to be a great piece of software for you to
use yourself and also for others to use.  Us users are all very
appreciative that you have made Ion available.  (Certainly you could
decide not to make any new releases of Ion publicly available anymore at
all, but I imagine that you, like myself and other free software
developers, enjoy seeing others benefiting from your work.)

Certainly users cannot have any expectation of support from you, even if
they are using the latest version; clearly they are better off getting
the Ion source code from you without support than not getting Ion at
all.

If you decide you are willing to provide support for the latest
unmodified version, that is, of course, an added bonus.

It seems that your primary motivations for the recent
licensing/trademark/distribution changes are twofold:

1. You do not want the reputation of Ion (and your work) to be hurt due
to distributions associating the name Ion with old or patched (and
therefore possibly worse) versions of Ion.

2. You do not want to have to deal with support requests for old or
modified versions of Ion.

In addition, you might also want to ensure that everyone using Ion is
using the best possible version (which you assume to be the current,
unmodified version), and therefore would like to make sure that the
current version is the one most readily available/convenient for all
users.  (Therefore, you'd like to ensure that if distributions make Ion
available as a package (thus more convenient than downloading it from
the Ion web page directly), the current version is the one that will be
available.)

I'll address the first two objectives below, but I'll explain first why
this last objective does not need to be considered: I think that it
really is reasonable for distributions to decide what version of Ion to
provide users; it doesn't make sense to try to force users of some
&quot;stable&quot; distribution, like Debian stable, to use the very latest
version of Ion.  One significant reason users pick a distribution is
because they _want_ to follow the judgment of the distribution packagers
in selecting particular versions of packages and particular patches to
apply.  You might not agree with the decisions made by the distribution
packagers, but except to the extent that it relates to the first two
objectives, I don't think you should be concerned about users being
given convenient access to &quot;sub-standard&quot; versions of Ion.

As far as the first objective, it is common knowledge that distributions
often make significant patches to the packages they distribute, and
sometimes those patches can change the behavior of the package in
certain ways, or in the worst case introduce bugs.  It is also common
knowledge that distributions typically don't always distribute the
latest version of a package.  Distributions typically will still call
the package by its original name, but users should know that the program
they receive from the distribution package is not exactly the same as
the latest version of the original package.  More importantly, though,
you can ensure that this fact is very clear by requesting that
distributions include a very prominent message in any packages of Ion
that are modified or not current.  The message can state very clearly
that the distribution-created package provides a modified version of Ion
that may have additional bugs or missing features compared to the
current official version.  This message can be displayed both during
installation, and also perhaps upon the first launch after an upgrade
and upon the very first launch after a new installation.  I think this
simple request should suffice for satisfying the first objective.

As far as the second objective, the problem seems to come down to
eliminating what you would consider to be effectively junk e-mails
(support requests for old/modified Ion versions) from the Ion mailing
list.  I think this can be achieved by requesting that distributions add
a notice to packages for old/modified versions of Ion that users should
not spam the Ion mailing list with support requests, but rather should
send the request to the distribution package maintainer.  Furthermore,
you could include a message by all places that list the address for the
Ion mailing list that you are willing to provide support for the current
official Ion version, but you don't have time to provide support for old
or modified versions of Ion, and therefore support questions regarding
old or modified versions of Ion should not be sent to the list.  You can
request, also, that any support request should explicitly state at the
beginning of the message what version of Ion is used, such that you can
easily filter an inappropriate support requests.

I think distributions should certainly try to respect your wishes
regarding the packaging of Ion, regardless of whether you find a way to
legally enforce that; as I see it, laws govern the interactions of
enemies, not the interactions of friends, and I'd like to think that
there can be a friendly relationship between distribution package
maintainers, users, and free software developers.  Trying to impose
these various additional license/trademark restrictions will only create
additional hassle for everyone, while providing little real gain for
you; in the end, fewer people will be able to benefit from your work,
either because they don't bother to try Ion because it is not included
in their distribution (even if such a user would eventually build Ion
from source, someone merely looking to &quot;check out&quot; Ion is less likely to
do so if it requires manually obtaining the source code, building it,
and installing it), or because they would like to incorporate some code
from Ion into another project, but because of the license restrictions,
cannot do this.
