TV&gt; Actually, you could implement a sticky joe-like help screen relatively
TV&gt; easily with a multi-line statusbar... if someone bothered to write
TV&gt; the multi-line support. And with a little hacking, you could create
TV&gt; some interactive tutoring: make the strings for the keys meters,
TV&gt; and give a suitable attribute to colourise the key you want the user 
TV&gt; to press.

I think this kind of help should actually live in the scratchpad, it's
exactly the right pop-up model.

Also, it should automatically discover the current key bindings for
commands.  So if I rebind &quot;delete split&quot; to key X, I want to see X
there.

&gt;&gt;<i> My point was only that interactive tutorials are useful.  At least in

TV&gt; Sure, but someone still needs to write them.

OK, let's start with a script.

blank screen = first start (determined by Ion, e.g. by missing ~/.ion3
directory)

Dialog &quot;You seem to be using Ion for the first time.  Would you like a
brief tutorial?&quot;

If yes:

Text &quot;This is a workspace in the Ion window manager.  It can do

1) ...
2) ...
3) ...

Let's start with (1).  Press &lt;KEY&gt; to open a terminal.&quot;

Does this seem like the right way to go, a linear tutorial that
introduces simple concepts one by one?

Is anyone interested in contributing to the script or the code to
implement it?

Ted
