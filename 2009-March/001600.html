*sigh* Even in my Windows switch, FOSS crap causes the most trouble. 
GHC: fail (=&gt; Darcs: fail, lua-xgettext: fail, riot: fail).
Ikiwiki: fail. And Cygwin itself poorly supports locales (i.e., UTF-8
in practise), although with some effort I've managed to make it mostly
work. Ion is one that doesn't support non-ascii... with the settings 
that other stuff works with. The problem seems to be, once again, that
X doesn't quite understand the cygwin/libc locales. Cygwin bash is 
also _slow_... actually wrote my first _much_ faster (still under cygwin)
python program [1] ever thanks to this.

Windows (XP) itself works quite smoothly.. far better than Modern
Linux, so far.. but doesn't natively provide all the software I'd 
like to use. Maybe coLinux would work better than Cygwin, although
it's in principle an ugly solution, and seems to be poorly supported
and difficult to set up... plus you have to deal with all the current
Linux crap [2] that I want to escape from, unless there's some lightweight
coLinux-oriented distro that strips away all that useless crap.

If only Apple wasn't so blur-fascist, and had 4:3 laptops with a
nipple... Although, I did try the _huge_ touchpad on one of the newer
Apple laptops recently, and it was far better than most I've come 
across: no need to be skating back and forth, actually quite comfortable
to move the cursor with it. But, still, it's in the way of typing -- 
can't rest your thumbs anywhere, whereas on the Trackpoint you can 
comfortable rest them on the buttons, ready to press -- and you need
to move your hand to actually use it, while the Trackpoint is simply
an integral part of the keyboard.

  [1]: A small tool to backup ID3 tags, eyeD3 providing a python library for
       reading and copying the raw frames to dummy files. Since copying my
       music collection from CDs and DVDs to a hard drive -- it's quite
       incredible in how small a package 500G goes in a usb-powered 2.5&quot;
       disk, compared to the pile of 3.5&quot; disks I had with combined capacity
       of just 300G... and these aren't big compared to stuff you find from
       the 80's -- and switching from mocp to foobar2000, I've been adding
       tags to my collection and downloading cover art, and need to back them
       up separately.
