Tables are never normally created by code.  That would be akin to Python
code generating a source file with a slightly different class definition
in it and telling the interpreter to load it.  You can do it, but it's
not recommended!  I would probably have a schema more like:

  files:
    fileid  INTEGER  NOT NULL  PRIMARY KEY

  tags:
    tag         TEXT  NOT NULL  PRIMARY KEY,
    description TEXT

  filetags:
    tag    TEXT     NOT NULL  REFERENCES tags,
    fileid INTEGER  NOT NULL  REFERENCES files ON DELETE CASCADE,
      PRIMARY KEY (tag, fileid)

In more human terms I would have a table of files, the purpose of which
is to give you the fileid (sort of like the inode number), a table of
tags that define what tags are known, and a table containing the pairs
(tag,fileid) that define what files have what tags.

I would rely on the database to optimise things where necessary---big
databases are fairly amazing at this, Postgres has a good planner and
MySql doesn't.  Tables should have few columns (I tend to think of them
as generalisations of functions) and lots of rows.  I'm working with
a dataset (under Postgres) that has several tables with &gt;100million
rows and everything is fine, rows are not a problem.

If you've ever done any logic programming (Mercury[1] is nice if you're
used to Haskell) then relations (tables) are similar to predicates in
that functions don't just have to return one value.  A bit like lifting
things into Maybe or List Monads in Haskell, except even cleaner than
Haskell.  You know up front if they're going to return either one result
or fail (zero results), or return many (zero or more) results.

Hope that makes sense!

&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think it's implemented anywhere at the moment, but have you

</I>&gt;<i> Nope. It would be nice to have something that provides nice and simple

</I>
Yes it would!
