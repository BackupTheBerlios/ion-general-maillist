As already mentioned, this has the problem that the user has to be
able to toggle it on, _and_ also has to toggle it off to do anything.
The statusbar would provide a constantly visible help or instruction
area.

&gt;<i> Also, it should automatically discover the current key bindings for
</I>&gt;<i> commands.  So if I rebind &quot;delete split&quot; to key X, I want to see X

</I>
There are no identifiable commands, only arbitrary function calls.
(The closest Ion comes to commands, is the context menu...) However,
by overriding `defbindings`, it is possible to store this information
and the `bdoc` documentation -- which may, however, be too long for 
a simple statusbar help display.

&gt;<i> blank screen = first start (determined by Ion, e.g. by missing ~/.ion3
</I>&gt;<i> directory)
</I>
Ion already has first start detection, for the welcome xmessage --
that many seem to ignore.

&gt;<i> Does this seem like the right way to go, a linear tutorial that
</I>&gt;<i> introduces simple concepts one by one?
</I>
Perhaps, but as already mentioned, in the scratchpad, it has the
problem of the user having to constantly toggle it.
