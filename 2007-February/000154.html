This is precisely one thing that I want to avoid, the names of files 
changing automatically. If one were to allow for that, one might be able
to work with a standard metacrap file system. In the &quot;SetFS&quot;, as I call 
it, you'll just have to add an additional tag to any &quot;followup&quot; files.
Yes, every &quot;file&quot; is a both a directory and a file, when you map
SetFS to the conventional unix file hierarchies. So, if you have
the file 'foo/bar' and want another file with the same tags, you'll
just have to use 'foo/bar/1' or something, and maybe manually rename
the original 'foo/bar/0', if you really want that.

One should less think of SetFS as a database file system with lots of
tags applied to each file, and more of as a plain old file system but
without the hierarchy. Of course, one could always add an additional set 
of meta-tags that do not contribute to the name of the file, just like
one could do filtering by creation date, etc. for search, but not 
addressing a particular file. (Accessing a particular file would just
ignore specially formed path elements.)

</I>
I agree. Too bad few people who hate it, get into it.
