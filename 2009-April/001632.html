Oh, no, there's no single one thing that killed X, but all the
recent actions to &quot;modernise&quot; (read: over-complexify) it:

&quot;DOS as a simple and manageable system was the high point of computing. XP
was a local maximum: the last OS with good fonts, and not even nearly as bad
as W95, around the release of which I switched from DOS to what can now
clearly be seen as the failure known as Linux/FOSS.&quot;

Vista does suck in my experience... in vmware. But I use XP.
Windows 7 sees like in improvement.. based on vmware tests.

You can select a W98-lookalike theme in both Vista and W7,
and as a nice side effect blurring gets disabled.

In 1995, Linux was almost a bicycle; an alternative way of live to the
Windows petrol beasts that had to be taken to the dealer for service.
By 2008, Linux has bloated into a gas-guzzler, and local vendors and
artisans have had to yield to &quot;all under one roof&quot; big box hypermarkets.
