Before I removed the support (and a while after it), there were people very
frequently complaining how focus in Xinerama is broken, how positioning of
floating frames is broken, and so on. I have better things to use my time
on than explaining things to those planet-wrecking conspicious consumers,
or trying to fix a feature I'd have hard time testing. (I _do_ have my
hypothetical 20-year-old telly[*] as a second screen in X, but none of 
this Xinerama crap, and switching to Xinerama and maintaining a second 
configuration is too much trouble.)

[*] Soon the computer -- or rather, $torrent-tracker-of-choice -- will be 
its only image source, as the planet-wrecking government and TV companies 
will be shutting down analogue transmissions on cable too. I have on plans
of getting additional unusable (to the power of n) electronic junk to convert
a digital signal to analogue. The DigiTV transition in Finland is an ecological 
and usability disaster. Forcing people (who want to watch that crap on TV)
to buy _temporary_ electronic junk before their old TVs die of age, and 
they'd get new ones with in-built digital receivers... not to even speak
of the brain damage of not going straight with HDTV. DigiTV was originally
a plan for a centralised poor man's internet, but those plans of long ago
been abandoned, and now they're just sending the same old signal in digital
form.. and luring people into pay-tv. Now, for terrestrial transmissions 
there may be very good reasons for freeing up the bandwidth, but in cable 
there's plenty to share.
