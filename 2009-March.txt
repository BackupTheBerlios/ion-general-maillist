  That didn't work; with JDK 1.7 it still fails. It must be due to something new of JDK 1.7 since earlier versions work now.
  Your patch fixed the focus loss in Java 1.6 but makes Java 1.7 applications not receive focus; it is a bug for a bug but I think Java 1.6 apps are more important right now; so I will start using it.

Subject: Difficulties when running ion on place
Message-ID: <58294.48221.qm@web53210.mail.re2.yahoo.com>


 Hi, I tried to compile and run ion3 without installing it and I took apparently the painful way.
 I ended up copying most .lua and configuration files to ~/.ion3/lib just because ion3 was looking for them there and otherwise couldn't find them. (Why can't it try also in the current directory?).

 Then I found that ion started with a ?segmentation fault? error (more info below). Much later I discovered the cause: there was a file I couldn't copy to ~/.ion3/lib because it wasn't in ion's source. It is look.lua and is created in the etc/Makefile as a symlink to look_newviolet.lua.

 My request is: instead of creating a link to it at install time, can ion really have a look.lua file which refers (like in #include) look_newviolet.lua? In this way the file doesn't need a special installation step; it is just copied like the others.
 If not, maybe the defaulting to look_newviolet.lua can be included in the C code, so that if it doesn't find look.lua at least it doesn't crash with a segmentation fault.
 I would even find better if ion stopped with an useful error message when it can't find look.lua.

The reason for symlinking is a marginal startup performance improvement :).

Actually, the styles menu does write dopath code in the session directory
look.lua, so maybe that should be done in the initial setup too.

Probably fixed by adding if(frame->brush!=NULL) test in frame_clear_shape.

I can't currently properly push these patches in the repository, as
I have yet to set up cygwin properly. The default "cygwin" darcs is
100% broken -- it's not a real cygwin build, but a super-dirty hack
that simply uses cygwin to build a native program, as is the case
with ghc -- and does not properly work with cygwin.

(Yes, I got a "new" computer, and at the moment it seems that it really
is Goodbye Linux! Incidentally, the biggest troubles with the Windows
(XP) switch are again that FOSS -- Cygwin -- is crap, slow, and doesn't 
even properly support multibyte encodings. Linux, well, it may be ready 
for the desktop, but it isn't ready for the laptop by a long stretch. 
But maybe I'll write something in the non-blog about it. Though I have 
to remark that the Trackpoint simply rocks.)

Message-ID: <e700999f0903022129q129db083l3af0b289b254c2d0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am just curious to know what do ion3 users do to manage painlessly
usb devices and network profiles.

I've done my tinkering with udev to configure my usb gadgets, but when
I have to read others' pendrives I simply spend an embarassingly long
time trying to figure out what node the device is attached to (plus
additional time spent on mount points & permissions issues). I've
heard that graphical environments like gnome or kde do that quite
automatically, but I don't see why a non-graphical environment could
not do the same thing.

The same goes for managing network profiles in a laptop. Gnome has
network-manager, a graphical tool that seems to do a good job. Again,
there is no need to rely on a widget to do this kind of task, but I
haven't found yet a convincing non-graphical solution.

Any ideas?

Best

Tuomov has written up something that brings it quite to the point:
http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/b/archives/2008/10/29/T20_34_21/

As I only use a handfull of usb devices I have added entries in /etc/fstab
for them (see http://www.jan0sch.de/wissen/ubuntu-usb-per-hand-mounten if
your familiar with german language).

Greetings,

Jens

Hi, Mico!

I'm risking to get a pail of slops on my head but stupid, braindead,
shit-styled, awful, G*d damned, and despite this widely used desktop
environments like *nome, *DE, *FCE etc are much more user friendly than
progressive (and marginal, be honest) ones.  I use Ion since 2nd
release and quite bored to fix daughter windows properties for some
poorly designed (actually just not Ion-designed) applications.  Last
times I run *nome-panel before Ion in my .xsession to get a bit of
usability and comfortable mounting also.

I like Ion.  I like its minimalism.  But actually I like the
possibility to create/destroy as much desktops as I want and make it
dynamically.  That is all I really need.  Now I'm looking for
possibility of this in *nome DE or FVWM, which can be runned beneath
*nome DE.  If I'd do, I'll leave Ion forever.  Man must be ready for
hard decisions, yeah...

SafelyRemove <http://safelyremove.com/> is quite nice.

For Windows, that is.

An update: pmount is actually crap, because there's no way to
specify mount options. So FAT and NTFS are permissions are broken,
which most USB devices carry.

I can provide my ls-removable script that lists removable devices
and lets you mount/unmount with pmount by pressing a number, if
someone is interested. I don't have it right now with me.

However, at least in (X)ubuntu 8.10 they've managed to stop pmount
from working, apparently due to changes in /sys layout. It can't 
decide whether a device is removable. So much for that. The only
way I know of mounting without suding in my current not-much-used
Linux installation is to run Thunar. Sucks. Well, at least it uses
the label instead of the *random* device node name under /media, unlike
pmount. But /media sucks donkey balls. The Windows scheme of simple and
short drive letters is _so_ _much_ _more_ convenient to use. 

(Incidentally (X)ubuntu (8.10) must be one of the most broken operating
systems on planet earth. But Lenny wasn't much better: still no hibernate
out of the box, would need kernel compilation. No thanks. Not anymore. 
It only works if you sacrifice a goat before the act in Xubuntu too, 
though. If one wants reliability, one chooses Windows today. Wouldn't
have guessed it ten years ago. 

And when Xubuntu does actually wake up from suspend or hibernate, I 
really don't like seeing the display contents flash before the screen
lock activates... What a total POS: gnome-power-damager. Crapware, 
where switching to AC lowers screen brightness! (8.04) Idiotic crap 
without absolute battery backlight levels, but rather adjustment 
percentages and rounding, that causes drift.)

Use a filemanager with udev-dbus support like dolphin.
Circumvent the whole udev-dbus stuff by putting your usb devices in 
/etc/fstab or use sudo mount.

Usually it would be easy enough to have a shell script for each 
connection profile, except "managing network profiles in a laptop" 
means something that can't be done with a simple script.

Hi,

It seems that with USB sticks the only option you have (apart from
finding and mounting them manually) is HAL-based automounting, for
example, HAL + ivman + pmount. Then you can add some nice tricks with
mod_ionflux, for example, create a menu with all mounted drives and
commands to unmount & eject them.

With network profiles you actually have a lot of options, starting from
ifupdown scripts in Debian, where you can specify a profile manually,
through 'divine', a nice small program that is able to send ARP requests
to specified hosts to check if they are on the network and then
configure the interface, to 'guessnet' - a plug-in for ifupdown, which
can do the same things as 'divine' and some more.

While the last configuration (ifupdown + guessnet) is quite complex to
set up, it offers you the most flexibility - for example. your laptop
can select network profiles based on the ESSID of the Wi-Fi access point
you are connected to, or on the presence of specific hosts on the wired
network, and you can always override the selection manually.

don't you worry. ;-)
Have you tried e17 (enlightenment dr17)? I use it on my laptop (compiled
from svn/cvs) and it is quite nice. Meanwhile it even has a tiling mode
(mod_tile) that is not as good as ion's tiling but it is usable.
I prefer ion on my workstation but on the laptop e17 does well.

Jens

NetworkManager (and its applet) are one of the few things that actually
didn't totally suck abount Xubuntu. Could even get VPN working with less
effort than Windows. (F-secure + Cisco VPN client -> BSOD, if you install
them in that order. The only one I've had, while Linux has locked up many
times on console switches etc.) Otherwise, can't say much good about 
wireless in Xubuntu: all the radios blasting at full power on startup, 
have to manually turn them off, instead of it remembering the settings.      
And in 8.04 the Fn-key radio button just toggled the first device of
wifi/bluetooth, while in 8.10 it cycles through the combos without  
indicating the current choice: bluetooth led works, but wifi led doesn't.
In Windows I get a nice popup where to turn radios on/off, and it 
remembers the settings.

(As a temporary measure, I've been just running the XFCE panel as 
Ion's stdisp for all the systray shit. But it sucks, because it 
can't align stuff to the right in the non-fullwidth mode.)

Here's my ls-removable script too. It's in Lua, and needs
both luafilesystem and posix packages for Lua.

There are two versions. The suffix-1 version worked with
the old 2.6.18 or whateveritwas Etch. Suffix-2 is a
conversion to work the modified /sys layout in *buntu 8.10,
but it fails to work because pmount doesn't seem to have
been upgraded to to reflect that. It, however, shouldn't be
too difficult to create a suid-root counterpart based on my
code, that just calls mount -- this time with sane FAT and
NTFS mounting arguments.

(*sigh*, even the ntfs-3g in 8.10 ubuntu is old, and does
not seem to support .NTFS-3G/UserMapping. A lot of shit in
it is _old_, and yet it has just half-a-year release

Subject: Problem with LC_CTYPE in ubuntu intrepid
Message-ID: <20090304062746.GI17199@Hardy>

Hi,
  Upgraded my distribution to ubuntu 8.10 on my PC and laptop a few
  days back. Built and installed the latest version of ion. On doing
  so, i am not able to type in queries. This problem is notoriously
  similar to the one i faced a few months back on my laptop running
  8.04. But back then changing the locale to en_US.utf8 had got it
  working. This time around, i am not so lucky. The errors reported in
  .xsession-errors are a bit different now.


/etc/gdm/Xsession: Beginning session setup...
Setting IM through im-switch for locale=en_IN.
Start IM through /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/default linked to /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/default.
ion3: No encoding given in LC_CTYPE.

  Not sure why is it complaining about the LC_CTYPE. Tried a multitude
  of places of exporting LC_CTYPE (.xsession, bashrc,
  /etc/environment), but the same error/message is reported. Could not
  find much relevant information on searching. Not sure where the
  problem is, although my doubt is that some configuration is done a
  bit differently in ubuntu intrepid. Could someone suggest a way for
  ion to read the LC_CTYPE variable. Typing in the command 'locale'
  gives out this

Yes, it's a typical problem that the encoding part of locale
is left unspecified. Xlib can't handle that, although AFAIK
the encoding configured for the locale should be available
from libc. Ion used to refuse localisation and complain loudly
if the encoding was missing from LC_CTYPE, but these days it 
just prints a warning which will only be seen in the logs.

While you're at it, write ion-power-manager. Something simple 
and reliable to replace the awful bloated and complicated 
gnome and kde crap. No fucking HAL crap; just talk to /sys,
acpi, whatever. Can be Thinkpad-specific. Indeed probably 
should be based on plugins specific to particular computer
models or classes instead of over-engineered low-level 
abstr^Windirection.

(I tried reading the gnome-power-damager code to see how it works... 
with the effort I put into it, I couldn't make heads and tails
of how it's interacting with other HAL/DBus crap; how the XSync 
extension is supposed to keep track of idle times -- the documentation
of the extension is poor at best -- if it is supposed to do that. 
You have to trace a gazillion levels of indirection.

I'd probably just use the screensaver extension for idle timing, 
if it can be tricked into multiple timeouts. After all, you want
to run the screen lock _before_  suspend/hibernate; the scripts
should synchronise the locking program startup, or just include
the screen lock in the power manager. The Gnome crap doesn't do 
this, and all the system-level scripts have finished restoring 
the system from suspension -- when all the sun spots are correctly
aligned and it all works -- before it seems to run the locker, 
which is a big gleaming security black hole.

But it's a lot of work to do all that, and for now Windows mostly
works for me. I'm really liking _reliable_ suspend and hibernate
in Windowsland, foobar2k, undervolting -- even that requires a fucking
kernel patch on the piece of shit Linux -- etc. Finally even managed
to get locales/UTF-8 working in Cygwin: the trick is to use
LC_CTYPE=C-UTF-8.UTF-8. The biggest problem ATM is getting a cygwin
version of darcs. If it doesn't work out, I may have to switch to 
Mercurial for Ion and my other projects.)

Subject: Scratchpad stuck in max size "mode"
Message-ID: <156407D9030C0D05013E3@kabelmail.de>

Hi all,

I have been struck by a very curious problem. The scratchpad, from one day to the next, decided it wanted to be, and remain, as large as my screen. It is not the full screen mode, that I can still toggle, but the frame size itself. I cannot reduce the size, and -- this is kinda spoky -- it has hit me at home as well as at work.

The two computers could hardly be any more different. One runs an old version of SuSE, the other a continually updated version of Ubuntu. (Guess which one is my own (-: )

I have tried to restart ion3, reboot, remove the $HOME/.ion directory, update ion3, etc, etc, but nothing seems to help.

Has anyone of you any idea of what's going on, and/or how it can be cured?

Most gratefully

Yours

Johannes

Have you upgraded recently? It may have wrong size policies etc. in 
that case. I suggest deleting the scratchpad (Mod1+C), and then 
reopening it (Mod1+space), when it will be recreated with correct
settings.

It's probably not this simple, but Meta-Enter toggles the current frame
between being the size of the entire display and its old size...pressing
it again might help, or get you to a mode where you can manually resize
with Meta-R?

This happens to me as well every now and again.  The frame won't shrink by keyboard or by mouse or by _:rqgeom and has to be closed, and then the newly recreated scratchpad resizes as normal until it happens again.  I'm also running the latest Ubuntu package.  I haven't been able to figure out what causes it.

Hello.

I have a scratchpad for IMs with a nested workspace in it
_:attach_new({type="WTiling"})
I can resize the frames in it now, but I am unable to resize the whole
scratchpad. How am I supposed to do so?

On the desktop I use varying things. TI-86, analog scope, loupe,
soldering station, random breadboards and stuff. Lots of pens and
paper. It might benefit from some automation but I can't find a
computer and interface of suitable size and connectivity.

Since I can't find Rotring XONOX any more, only the sloppy fat Tikky,
I have a Pigma Micron 005 (0.20mm line is maybe even too thin). It
doesn't have a straight clip, though so it tore the back of the
Moleskine in record time. I need a tougher notebook.


You may freely consider this a snipe at crap analogies used in
computing. Throw them away and things start to work better. Ion is a
good step forward in that.

Subject: Proportional tab sizes (ugly patch).
Message-ID: <20090315125649.7137a39d@u-pl17.ms.mff.cuni.cz>

Here I send patch for proportional tab sizes.

The patch itself is not acceptable because of two (interdependent)
issues:
  1.) I haven't time to examine source code to optimize for speed, and
      correct flow. (See using of 'complete' flag of
      grbrush_draw_textboxes, etc.)
  2.) It is the 'first shot' programming, i.e. it just works, but the
      code itself is rather ugly (e.g., I haven't put the new function
      in header file.)

But I haven't time for cleaning the code for next month or two, so I
send the patch as is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The algorithm now works in following way (I omit some border
widths here in the description as well as rounding errors.):

 * There are two constants:
   - float_tab_min_w (former tab_min_w, default 100)
       ... that is soft minimum width
   - propor_tab_min_w (new, default 30, I did not write code for
       redefinig) ... that is hard minimum width
 Let "n" be number of tabs.

 * If n*propor_tab_min_w is greater than space allocated to tabs
   ( ~ width of the frame in tiled workspace ), then tabs get sizes
   proportionaly like it was before this patch.

   |<--->| ... propor_tab_min_w
   _____________________________________________
   |T|A|B|S|_|T|H|A|T|_|A|R|E|_|T|O|O|_|M|A|N|Y|
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Else each tab gets at least propor_tab_min_w (even if it contains
   shorter label).

 * Now we set max_width to propor_tab_min_w, and we keep incrementing
   max_width until all tabs have their width or we use all the space
   reserved for tabs. In the latter case we stop and assign the widths
   to the tabs.

   |<--->| ... propor_tab_min_w
   |<-------------->| ... float_tab_min_w
   _____________________________________________
   | tab |  x  |a long ta...|another l...| xx  |
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * At this point all tabs have sizes of their labels (but at least
   propor_tab_min_w), but we may have some space left, now
   flow_tab_min_w comes to play. We set min_width to propor_tab_min_w
   and again we increment it until float_tab_min_w or all the space
   reserved for tabs is used. In the latter case we again stop and
   assign the widths.

   |<-------------->| ... float_tab_min_w
   _____________________________________________
   |here is a long tab|    tab    |     x      |
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


 * Now, each tab has at least float_tab_min_w width. If the frame is
   floating, then the tab sizes are used. If not, then remaining space
   is distributed among tabs, where we want padded space to be same
   for all tabs (but we don't shorten tabs that have float_tab_min_w
   width)

   |<-------------->| ... float_tab_min_w
   tiled:
   _____________________________________________
   |      tab       |    here is a long tab    |
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   float:
   _______________________________________
   |      tab       | here is a long tab |
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subject: Ikiwiki replacement etc.
Message-ID: <slrngrs5ts.d9i.tuomov@jolt.modeemi.cs.tut.fi>


I will have to replace Ikiwiki as the Ion site generator, since
it fails to work under Cygwin. (Excessive and ugly mangling of
all input into UTF-8 breaks down in the 2007 snapshot I'd been
using. *sigh*. The compiler doesn't need to know the encoding
used; only the web frontend does. Newer versions don't build. 
No response from the author.)

One thing that has been suggested, is webgen. But it seems that to do
all the inlining or even listing of all the FAQ entries, I'd have to
spend time learning Ruby/ERB/webgen internals, and I really have spent
far too much time on the computer/OS switch [1] already. A quick&dirty
Lua or shell script would be faster to write. (Actually, I hate the
way Ikiwiki handles intra-wiki links, with its own syntax instead of
using markdown. Webgen, OTOH, doesn't have any support for easy linking.
I'd like to just define ready aliases for markdown for pages on the
site. There actually exists a markdown implementation in Lua...)

Does anyone have any other suggestions for site generator, or what 
to do with the site, that wouldn't involve too much effort from me? 
This could also be tied to the scripts repository, distribution of 
extra patches etc..

I still refuse to edit pages through crappy browsers' editors,
and whatever is chosen should support markdown for easy conversion
(and because most other ASCII markup languages are too bloated).

Try AsciiDOC.  It has not any web engine just text-to-html converter.
Nice syntax, I spent an hour to get a site.  One page -- one
file.  UTF-8 is native for it.  Links look like
link:awesome-page.txt[The awesome page]

There is a highlighter for vim.

Which means "web engine"?  I meant no web engine -- no cgi, no web
forms, no page editor thru web forms, just kosher html.  You can manage
your pages with ftp.  Let the web server be engine.

No, I'm not looking for dynamic content. I'm looking for something
to generate static web pages; not he nicer-markup-to-html converter,
which will be markdown, but the part that wraps that into templates;
generates RSS; inlines multiple pages into one for news, FAQ;
offers nicer wiki-like linking rather than referring to individual
files; etc.

I just experimented with that quickly. I can resize the whole scratch pad with
the mouse (by clicking and dragging on its frame rather than the nested
tiling's). To resize with the keyboard, I have to switch to a tab on the
workspace which is not a nested WTiling.

You can bind something like the following to resize/move the parent of the
WTiling (which would be the scratch pad in this case):

 _:parent():begin_kbresize()

This is going to take some time. I, of course, can't even use the
usual tools to convert from darcs to another format, because
the non-deterministic windows-cygwin hybrid darcs does not even
print dates etc. in a standard format, so parsers fail.

(No, passing TZ does not work. Darcs shouldn't know about it,
as it's not a cygwin program. In truth, though, setting TZ
messes everything up. Must be a leak in GHC from depending
on cygwin for compilation, although it can not be compiled
for cygwin -- which is the reason why there's no cygwin
verion of darcs.)

...

Has anyone any experience of a simple coLinux setup?
That wouldn't mess hibernate/standby up? With internal
samba? No udev and other crap; Windows handles devices.

Another big project is writing a non-Haskell (read: Lua)

Hi Tuomo,

have you already decided which SCM you want to switch to? I have noticed
you took a look at mercurial... I for myself am very content with it,
but I know that your requirements have mostly a little higher level.

Regards,
Nicolas

Probably Mercurial. I've been using it for all new repositories 
anyway. It mostly sucks compared to darcs, but I don't know anything
better that's portable. Stupid GHC, stupid compilers, their
bootstrapping, and complicated build systems.

*sigh* Even in my Windows switch, FOSS crap causes the most trouble. 
GHC: fail (=> Darcs: fail, lua-xgettext: fail, riot: fail).
Ikiwiki: fail. And Cygwin itself poorly supports locales (i.e., UTF-8
in practise), although with some effort I've managed to make it mostly
work. Ion is one that doesn't support non-ascii... with the settings 
that other stuff works with. The problem seems to be, once again, that
X doesn't quite understand the cygwin/libc locales. Cygwin bash is 
also _slow_... actually wrote my first _much_ faster (still under cygwin)
python program [1] ever thanks to this.

Windows (XP) itself works quite smoothly.. far better than Modern
Linux, so far.. but doesn't natively provide all the software I'd 
like to use. Maybe coLinux would work better than Cygwin, although
it's in principle an ugly solution, and seems to be poorly supported
and difficult to set up... plus you have to deal with all the current
Linux crap [2] that I want to escape from, unless there's some lightweight
coLinux-oriented distro that strips away all that useless crap.

If only Apple wasn't so blur-fascist, and had 4:3 laptops with a
nipple... Although, I did try the _huge_ touchpad on one of the newer
Apple laptops recently, and it was far better than most I've come 
across: no need to be skating back and forth, actually quite comfortable
to move the cursor with it. But, still, it's in the way of typing -- 
can't rest your thumbs anywhere, whereas on the Trackpoint you can 
comfortable rest them on the buttons, ready to press -- and you need
to move your hand to actually use it, while the Trackpoint is simply
an integral part of the keyboard.

  [1]: A small tool to backup ID3 tags, eyeD3 providing a python library for
       reading and copying the raw frames to dummy files. Since copying my
       music collection from CDs and DVDs to a hard drive -- it's quite
       incredible in how small a package 500G goes in a usb-powered 2.5"
       disk, compared to the pile of 3.5" disks I had with combined capacity
       of just 300G... and these aren't big compared to stuff you find from
       the 80's -- and switching from mocp to foobar2000, I've been adding
       tags to my collection and downloading cover art, and need to back them
       up separately.

And the "slide with two fingers scrolls whatever content you have" is
incredibly handy. Luckily this is being copied to more and more
computers (netbooks).
The rest is mostly candy for demoes, but the zoom and rotate features
are cool and handy for the visual stuff.

I'm testing this right now. That's not really a problem to keep your
thumbs on the trackpad, even with the "tap-mode" activated. If they
move a little, your mouse will flicker (thak God, it disappears when
you're typing), but that's not really a big deal.

The most painful is Window Management (missing ion so much) and that
"Spaces" multi-desktop thing not well integrated, especially
overriding some keyboard bindings (which are "customisable with
limited choices", all of them not satisfying).

You may find yourself disappointed at their quite-non-standard
keyboard layout and some other inconsistencies, but they're less
painful.

Apparently there are some external tools but they tend to break things
more than they solve problems.

Well, yes, but the situation is almost the same on PCs: all the 
affordable models have a glossy screen.. and typically crappy 
keyboards. And the nipple you find only on the el cheapo Thinkpad
SL models. The better T-model Thinkpads are just as expensive
as Macbook Pros in .fi but come with a shallowscreen and megabezels
these days. (The Thinkpads tend to be about 500e cheaper in .de 
compared to .fi!)

Would have to try for an extended period to find out if they'd
have managed to make it work tolerably, but so far I've always had
to disable to trackpad to be able to use a laptop.

Sure you can run Ion in X in OS X? I run it in Windows XP under
Cygwin/X, and half of my apps/windows there. (In Xterm, but
also plan to use gv/xpdf/xdvi for TeXing when it comes time 
to write something again.) It works comfortably enough, switching
between Windows and Ion, after I changed Mod1+Tab to Mod1+Q
in Ion, instead of passing -keyhook to X, which disables the
Windows key too, which I'd like to work (could then Win+tab
on the taskbar). This keeps the Windows window-count tolerable;
it couldn't handle the gazillion terminals comfortably without 
a tabbing terminal emulator or something... but that's just Ion
then; I consider it my "IDE".

> You may find yourself disappointed at their quite-non-standard
> keyboard layout 

I have to reconfigure the keyboard on any system I plan to actually
use for anything, in any case. Done that on Windows too. (Caps lock = 
control, extra altgr between shift and z, extra altgr+key bindings [1].
No dead keys, they suck.)

I used to use it for a while with the default-debian-image, which I
upgraded to a recent version. Hibernation works flawlessly, as it is just a
Windows-Application as any other. It's much faster as cygwin. I don't know
if it can be suspended alone, so you can reboot windows without rebooting
your Linux.

I even used it to connect to my real XFS-partition of the real Linux
besides my Windows, so I could access the data via samba, because there is
no XFS-driver for Windows.

I used XMing as X-Server, which was quite fast.

I don't use it anymore, because Windows drove me crazy, so now I
virtualized Windows in VirtualBox for the few applications I need.

Ah, OK. So it's a driver and a service. Anyway, it was pretty stable.

Yes, but I can use both my cores and don't have to reserve one for my
virus-scanner. From my point of view, Windows is still worse.

e.g. you can't overwrite a file, when it is executed.
You can't open a file when another application writes in it (how am a I
supposed to read logfiles?). A path in NTFS is not allowed to be longer
than 255 chars... And worst of all: it lacks a package-management.

Maybe I'll try it one day. No time now.

Both cores.. doing fine with just one. Only really notice the scanner
at login, which takes ages, just like the boot too. But with reliable
standby/hibernate, it's not necessary to boot often, and you can still
shut down the system for the night, etc.

This is indeed a major annoyance that you can't delete a file
in use, as on *nix. At least in cygwin they can, however, be 
renamed out of the way. I've been told this should've been
improved in Vista.

> A path in NTFS is not allowed to be longer than 255 chars... 

Path? You mean file name? It's the same on ext2/3 as far as I
recall, and no practical limitation, just Linux fanboy FUD -- 
especially as NTFS uses Unicode, so special characters don't 
take many bytes as with UTF-8.

> And worst of all: it lacks a package-management.

Worst of all: Linux has fragmented centralised package 
management. All the gazillion distributions doing redundant
work have de facto central control over what software you 
can easily install on that particular distribution.

On Windows I can just download software from the ISV, and 
easily run it. In a sandbox if I want to. And, best of all,
nearly all the latest sofware still runs on Windows XP, which
is from 2001 (and largely still uninfected by the current 
blur-fascist IT regime). Try running latest Linux binaries
-- or even source, for that matter -- on Linux from 2001. 
FAIL.

It's sick. Linux is outright against independent software 
vendors, and yet it's Microsoft that gets sued for any 
feature they add to their OS.

I'm curious. Does Windows have that capability built in or do you use
some kind of sandboxing third party solution?

Just tried it out of curiosity, I got bored after about 6000
characters.

Yeah, the biggest problem is Windows users naming
directories like "Program Files", "Last year's review",
"Deliveries for this and that", which means the 255
limitation actually comes up quickly. Then try to convince
them to use short names and no spaces.

Actually I think NTFS uses UTF-16 which is about twice as
big as UTF-8 (Unicode being the numbering of letters, UTF-8
and UTF-16 being two encodings of Unicode).

Yeah, it sucks.. but it's coming in Linux too.
I absolutely fucking hate the Desktop directory
that every now and then shows up in ~.
IT'S MY HOME DIRECTORY YOU GNOME FUCKTARDS! DON'T PUT ANYTHING
VISIBLE THERE! I'S ***MIIIINE***, NOT YOURS, YOU  PIECE OF SHIT
RETARDS!! GET IT?!?!?

NTFS: 255 UTF-16 code points = 510 bytes
ext2: 255 _bytes_ = less than 255 UTF-8 characters even with latin alphabet.

This is what I meant.

Of course, even with UTF-16 you get less than 255 glyphs when
using combining characters and stuff.

Yes, it is possible to _create_ such file names, but you can't use 
them.  Here at WinXP I can create (best under "Desktop") dirs close to 
255 chars.
But if you try to put files into them, it won't work.  You can also put 
files in dirs <255 chars and then rename some of the dirs so that the 
full file name is
longer than 255 chars.  Then they become unusable: no icons, no clicks, 
nothing...

bye, Adam.

Actually, I've been succesfully using file names with colons in them
in Linux on NTFS (stupid NTFS-3g not failing on such names), and
Windows shows them, but you can't access them.

Actually, there is a low path length limit not in NTFS but in the some
old versions of the _Windows API_ itself.  This is probably what the FUD
was about. (And if you consider an API originating for 8+3 names -- if
this is the case -- 255 is a tolerable limitation for path length.)

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247.aspx

"""
In the Windows API (with some exceptions discussed in the following
paragraphs), the maximum length for a path is MAX_PATH, which is defined as
260 characters. A local path is structured in the following order: drive
letter, colon, backslash, components separated by backslashes, and a
terminating null character. For example, the maximum path on drive D is
"D:\<some 256 character path string><NUL>" where "<NUL>" represents the
invisible terminating null character for the current system codepage. (The
characters < > are used here for visual clarity and cannot be part of a
valid path string.)

Note  File I/O functions in the Windows API convert "/" to "\" as part of
converting the name to an NT-style name, except when using the "\\?\" prefix
as detailed in the following sections.

The Windows API has many functions that also have Unicode versions to permit
an extended-length path for a maximum total path length of 32,767 characters

  No, I don't think they get it... Try in a Gnome discussion list, there may be some Gnome developers there.

  By the way, is ~ really yours? Who created it? :-)

  Yes, I also hate it, but I have learnt to ignore it with version control. Or better, I use it to store trash. And if I want a directory that I control myself, I create one, it's not so complex.

But it's not ~, it's ~/my or /my or something long and non-automatic.

I suspect that when they realise this home directory cluttering problem,
instead of choosing saner names, they'll reinvent the wheel and introduce
a Hidden attribute to file systems... in an additional gnome indirection
layer, not the kernel.
