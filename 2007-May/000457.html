You're full of FUD. I'm sick of programs with broken autoconf 
scripts that take ages to run, and that are practically unfixable.
I will have nothing to do with the autoconf mess, since better 
solutions are possible.

Ah, gcc is fucked up too then.

The show-off.

I didn't have to look at how font systems work for several years, and
then they made everything use Xft and fontconfig, and now I have to
spend hours on it to get nice clear crisp fonts.

I didn't have to look at how device mapping works for several years,
and then they started the SCSI-mapping insanity and practically 
demanding udev. Now I have to waste hours to create a fucking symlink
in /dev.

No, SUV the size of a high-rise building is the penis enlargement
trend over here. The bicycle is a mere transportation necessity, 
assuming you agree that people need to move around faster and
longer distances than is practical by walking -- which isn't much
given the low densities. There's practically no public transport
thanks to the trend of enlarging penisis with the infernal machines
known cars, and the bicycle beats it in ecology in any case.

(And, yeah, &quot;diamond&quot; above of course refers to the standard 
bicycle frame shape.)
