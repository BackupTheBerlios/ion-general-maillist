&gt;<i> &gt;      The KDE interface contains 4,712,273 lines of code, has fixed 1,554
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      defects, has verified another 25 and has only 65 to go. Gnome
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      contains 430,809 lines of code, has fixed 357 defects, verified 5 and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      has 214 to go.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Umm... 4,712,273 vs. 430,809 lines of code? Surely they're not including
</I>&gt;<i> all of Gnome.
</I>
:<i>)
</I>
Also ... KDE: 1600 defects only per 5 million lines of code--it would be
outclassing the M-U-C-H tinier Postfix [how many lines? less than 50'000 I
bet, that is &lt; 1/100] which has been designed by a security expert programmer
with security as the goal from the start, already--and down from 1600 to 100
&quot;with only 65 to go&quot; by surplus. Miracle.

Quite likely it's about *defects* of a kind a given program can detect in
other programs (hello halting theorem) ... it recalls me very much the
statistics on Finland's guns which xinhuanet.com has (mis)quoted time ago [see
a previous, off-topic post].

Anyway. I have been told--by friends ... I have seen deserts only from the
windows of the airplanes, unfortunately--that a guide of the [African] desert
has commented once, in years in which GPS and GLONAS were not used yet, that
when rescue teams managed to locate people who went lost in the desert the
former nearly always managed to reconstruct how the latter did try to drink
EVERYTHING before dying: water from the flasks, water from the radiator of the
car, aftershave, shampoo, toothpaste, ...

At which stage are *we* [I mean, the people directly or indirectly mentioned
by the article]--drinking water of the radiator, or shampoo?

One reason more to love Ion, and ... cheers
