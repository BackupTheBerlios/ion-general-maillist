Maybe you've stuck to a few well-behaved applications in tiled 
mode.

If we get philosophical, rationality is bullshit too.

&gt;<i> I'm guessing you're agnostic since you seem to detest religion so much.
</I>
I'm just godless. (Good you didn't think of me as an atheist.)

Speaking of which, I recently watched the latest diatribe by Richard
Dawkins and, well, that guy chants &quot;Science and Reason&quot; more frequently
and with more fervor than US propaganda goes on about &quot;Freedom and
Democracy&quot;.

&gt;<i> ugly - subjective
</I>&gt;<i> blurry - subjective and dependant on the antialiasing used
</I>&gt;<i> unreadable - subjective
</I>&gt;<i> You (as admitted below) just hate anything new.
</I>
Subjectivity is the key. But the practises of the FOSS herd do not
support subjective tastes.

&gt;<i> Cryptic config is a pain wherever it is, but it's not as if the ion config  
</I>&gt;<i> file is stable in syntax.
</I>
You're talking about software in development stage. Now, of course, the 
distros where it changes are also in development, which brings as back to
topic: the software in the megafrozen (&quot;stable&quot;) is too old and too broken
to be of much use, so you have to use their even more broken development
versions. (Which, from what I call, even the &quot;stable&quot; releases of many
more frequently-snapshotted distros are.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ah - you're feeling opressed.  Then again you seem to feel victimised by
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> most walks of life if your blog is anything to go by. I think that's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mostly how you view the world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Modern technology mostly sucks.
</I>&gt;<i> Except vacuum cleaners I presume.
</I>
They have the unfortunate tendency to blow.

&gt;&gt;<i> It's more work for me to maintain all that code.
</I>&gt;<i> Not if it's correctly implemented when you integrate it.
</I>
Which means: a separate module, so I don't have to care about it. I don't
like having to wait weeks when trying to make a release, to see if the 
contributors have gone AWOL, will have time upgrading their (such as
autocrap), and so on. And I'm not going to start upgrading/fixing 
features I don't care for.
