</I>I simply want to queue with the others and say a big 'thank you'
for this great window manager. maybe it all sounds a bit to definitive
and obituary-like, but anyway. and maybe the last word is not spoken after
all -- hope never harms :-).

for the final(?) wish-list:
/
if a feature freeze is there and the definitive final version out,
maybe the community can somehow put together a good(!) comprehensive(!!)
HOWTO user manual for all the pedestrian users (more or less counting
myself under these) which do not really want to dive into the source
code and/or full-fledged lua-programming, but want to configure
ion3 to their liking and get their work done (think, e.g. of
`mutt' or `vim' documentation, although especially the latter is a
bit on the hypertrophic side...).

at one point I tried to compile ion2 myself under OSX. I failed (to many
library collisions, missing header files etc etc). which
does only say that much, namely that many potential users would have stopped at
that point and that's a pity.  as of now there is 3ds-20060524
available by one package management system (port) but no version at all by the
more wide-spread (debian derived) other (fink). I don't know how to
provide a package via these systems, but maybe someone out there
does.  I believe it would help to draw more attention to ion3 (which
it deserves) if it were possible to inject the final version into
as many package management systems as possible (don't know how it
stands with all the 'big' unix-es, linux-es and BSDs at the moment).




and last not least:
all the best for you and your future plans,

joerg
