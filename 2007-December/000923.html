&gt;&gt;<i> Oh - then how come I've never had any problems with it?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you've stuck to a few well-behaved applications in tiled

</I>Yes I feel that floating windows are rather counter to the concept of ion  
- but even so, that's quite different from &quot;it can't work&quot;.
Although my applications are anything but well behaved.  Fortunately  
vncviewer (the worst culprit in my mind) finds it hard to jump across the  
screens (even under xinerama) so stays jumping to the last selected frame  
on the one screen, allowing me to work on this one :)

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm guessing you're agnostic since you seem to detest religion so much.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just godless. (Good you didn't think of me as an atheist.)
</I>Atheism is a faith position - you seemed to eschew that vehemently, but at  
least you're consistent. (even if you are wrong ;-p )

&gt;<i> Speaking of which, I recently watched the latest diatribe by Richard
</I>&gt;<i> Dawkins and, well, that guy chants &quot;Science and Reason&quot; more frequently
</I>&gt;<i> and with more fervor than US propaganda goes on about &quot;Freedom and
</I>&gt;<i> Democracy&quot;.
</I>Ah - the athiest who claims he has no faith. He chants most things more  
frequently than anyone - he's probably figured out that he is in a faith  
position and can't work out how to back down... &lt;/off topic&gt;

&gt;<i> Subjectivity is the key. But the practises of the FOSS herd do not
</I>&gt;<i> support subjective tastes.
</I>Of course not - though shalt be clones.
Seriously - I agree with you, but as the whole thing doesn't support  
abstractions of context from presentation we have to work with what we  
have (unless you want to fork/reimplement the whole shooting match) That's  
one of the problems with any long project.  Abstraction is easy in short  
term tightly defined projects.
Or with hindsight.
But by then it's expensive.

&gt;&gt;<i> Cryptic config is a pain wherever it is, but it's not as if the ion  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> config file is stable in syntax.
</I>&gt;<i> You're talking about software in development stage.
</I>Yep - if the last &quot;stable&quot; release you made was over three years ago.
There is a balance to be had between stability and frequency.  I've never  
installed ion2, because I'd never actually seen it.  I spotted ion3 on a  
colleagues screen and asked what it was.
I've not gone back, because ion3 is actually pretty stable - for  
everything I do. I can't imagine there are many situations where it's  
horribly unstable/unusable, and for those ion2 may well cater.
You then get the opportunity for more testing and feedback on potential  
useful features.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Modern technology mostly sucks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Except vacuum cleaners I presume.
</I>&gt;<i> They have the unfortunate tendency to blow.
</I>See - you do have a sense of humour :) I knew it was there somewhere! :-D
