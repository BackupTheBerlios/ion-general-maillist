Except Finland is essentially an island in Europe (if it can
even be considered to be part of Europe; in many senses it's
dislocated on the wrong continent). To get by train alone to
central Europe, you'd have to go through somewhere in Russia,
and that's quite cumbersome, probably requiring visas etc.
(And the tracks suck, but incidentally they're now going to
improve the Helsinki-St. Petersburg tracks and byu new faster
trains for it, while at the same time the railroads within
Finland keep rotting, and the same expensive Pendolinos travel
at snail's speed on them. Most of the tracks also have only
a single rail-pair with occasional waiting tracks, so their
capacity is at saturation and can't handle more cargo. And 
yet roads are constantly improved on the excuse of safer 
trucking. Typical Finnish extremely Helsinki-centric petrol
fascist politics.)

The best way to get from Finland to central Europe that doesn't
require using an airplane, is probably an overnight ferry from
Helsinki or Turku to Stockholm, and train from there through 
Denmark to Germany, etc. Ferry to Tallinn would be faster, but
the Baltics don't have decent railroads. Alternatively you take
ferry from Helsinki to Rostock or so, which takes about one and
a half days or so.

</I>
Yep, the official religion of this country is transition from
petrol fascism to agro-petrol fascism.

&gt;<i> I am *lucky* (like most people too, well): I am right-handed!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would I have been left-handed instead, I would not--I mean, not
</I>&gt;<i> with this notebook I am using right now and like VERY MUCH--be
</I>&gt;<i> able to keep the mouse 10-15 cm on the right of the keyboard.
</I>
I am right-handed, but I use the rat with my left hand. Why?
Just look at the typical clusterfuck keyboard design. The 
distance to the mouse on the left is much shorter from the
typing position. It's still a chore to reach for the mouse,
however. And despite how crappy the mouse it, nipples, touchpads
and other more easily reached alternatives are far worse than
it otherwise. The touchpad in particular must be forbidden 
technology under some human rights conventions.

&gt;<i> I use a vi-like editor EVERYWHERE I can. And don't hesitate to
</I>&gt;<i> grasp the mouse EVERY TIME it makes sense--which it happens
</I>&gt;<i> often enough. The mouse sustains/complements well vi, I have not
</I>&gt;<i> noticed *problems*.
</I>
The mouse can complement the keyboard, that is _rarely_ the 
case when you are typing or otherwise almost constantly using 
the keyboard with both hands. The mouse best complements the 
keyboards when you can keep one hand on the keyboard and other
on the mouse. This works out quite nicely in e.g. Blender's
interface, and first-person-shooter games.

&gt;<i> I am too extreme? Not sure. Dijkstra^1 tells: --&quot;Besides
</I>&gt;<i> mathematical inclination, an exceptionally good mastery of
</I>&gt;<i> one's native tongue is the most vital asset of a competent
</I>&gt;<i> programmer.&quot;-- And he is quite likely right. 
</I>
This claim is probably related to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis,
and it probably is not important that the language one is 
proficient in is even one's native language, just some 
language. Most people, however, are most proficient in their
native language.
