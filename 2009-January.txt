Hi Tuomo, thanks for the patch. Unfortunately I still experience problems with
frames getting stuck at 0 width or height after doing a 'Mod1-K V' or 'Mod1-K H'
in a neighboring frame. Fortunately I can reproduce it reliably:

1) Start with a 'full' tiled workspace containing a single frame.
2) Mod1-S to do a vertical split
3) In the top frame repeated 'Mod1-K V' toggle the bottom frame from 0 height
and then back to half the screen height, as expected.
4) Again in the top frame do a 'Mod1-K S' to do a horizontal split.
5) In one of the top frames do a 'Mod1-K V' to collapse the bottom frame. Then
'Mod1-TAB' to the other top frame and 'Mod1-K V'... the bottom frame
unexpectedly stays at 0!

(The same thing happens using 'Mod1-K H' in horizontal-split frames.) The key to
reproducing the problem is to switch between maximized frames while the
minimized frame is at 0 height/width, it then becomes impossible to resize the
minimized frame from the keyboard.

Let me know if you need a better description (or if I'm experiencing some
user-error/misconception).

Ah... well I'd classify that as an (unintentional) feature then. 
Maximise is completely unaware of tiling/layout, it just works on
a per-frame basis. It should be done somewhat differently (snapshotting
entire layout instead of just saving the size of a single frame) for 
what you want to work. It'st hus will not be changed in the stable 
Ion3. For Ion3plus a good-quality patch would certainly be accepted;
if I ever find the time, I may even do it myself.

Ah, I see. But what I think is still a bug is that after performing a 'Mod1-K V'
in the other top frame (as in step 5 in my example), then the originally
maximized frame forgets its original height. 'Mod1-TAB'ing to it and trying to
un-maximize it with 'Mod1-K V' has no effect, although even with the intended
per-frame maximize I would expect it to (right?). Also, resizing ('Mod1-R') in
the bottom frame has no effect at this point, it is stuck at 0 height.

Yes, that's what I really want. Hopefully it will annoy me enough that I'll
finally take a little time to learn enough of the Ion3plus code that I can turn
out a patch that's at least good enough for my purposes.

Thanks for everything, I hope your PhD defense/preparations went (are going)

Which scripts? If you set environment variable PATH for ion to contain
~/bin, it will search executables there also. You can check your PATH
setting in ion by Mod1+F3 (opens Query for lua code to exectute), then
you type:

 mod_query.message(_, os.get_env('PATH'))

This lets you see the content of your PATH variable for ion.

Setting PATH variable depends on the way how you launch ion.

Ion also has its own search path for its scripts. You can set
it from the command line, or modifying the searchpath field of
ioncore.set/get_paths.

The logic is that frames store their size when they're specifically
shaded or maximised, and forget the stored size whenever they are
otherwise resized -- including resizing is enforced in a tiled layout
whenever some other frame is resized. Fixing these annoyances you've
pointed out, involves a different kind of logic not based on maximizing
individual frames, but altering the entire layout somehow.

I meant bash scripts or executables not ion scripts.

I tried
    mod_query.message(_, os.get_env('PATH'))
but I got an error :
    attempt to call field 'get_env' (a nil value)

I launch ion with exec ion3 in my .xsession and gdm.

It's getenv. (There's also a shorter way to display values
from queries, as the Lua print function is overridden in them:
print(os.getenv("PATH")) )

> I launch ion with exec ion3 in my .xsession and gdm.

Then set PATH in your .xsession before launching Ion.
setenv is also provided by the Lua posix module, but
it's better to set the PATH by loading some .bashenv or
something from .xsession. 

(Actually, it's all a big mess, because the crappy display 
managers don't load the shells' environment from anywhere, 
but you should do redundant work by defining the stuff in 
.xsession again. But .xsession is also sometimes loaded by
stock xinitrc these days, and in that case then you shouldn't 
load the environment definitions again.)

Thanks, it works very well. If there's a better way than using gdm, I am
interested (I don't like gnome very much).

Why don't you just login on a text console and run startx?

I also have the following code in my .bash_profile, which automatically
starts X, when I log in from the first text console:

if [ "$(tty)" = "/dev/tty1" -o "$(tty)" = "/dev/vc/1" ] ; then
	startx
fi

This way I don't need a display manager and still have the only
functionality from them I used (startup of the X session on login).

If you still want a graphical display manager, you could try slim[1].
It is much lighter.

Windows 7. If it's come out when I get a notebook.

If one can find an affordable notebook with a *matte* screen anymore,
when I finally need a mobile computer; right now I don't. Glossy 
*trinkets* attract the herd like fly traps attract flies, and so it's
hard to find anything that doesn't hurt your eyes anymore. Another 
thing I've noticed is that even tabletops tend to come with _shitty_
laptop-like keyboards these days with too short movement of the keys
to be comfortable to type. But the herd is happy with them, and so
all the time it becomes more and more trouble to find even something
half-decent -- that was standard a few years before -- let alone 
something actually good.

Yes, W7 is Hitlery [1], but better than Vista (or Modern Linux, 
and worse than XP or Old Unix. But you need Modern OS to run
a Modern Browser to use Modern Internet Services, etc. All 
of them shit, but all the time getting more complicated to
live without. Unfortunately.)

All the glyphs look like swastikas, they're so blurred [2].

They've actually finally _removed_ the option to disable font 
blurring from the panel where it was easily accessible in XP, 
and which you had to hunt a bit in Vista, and even after then
didn't disable all blurring. They've added a Smeartype tuner 
that lets you choose between a zillion types of blurring, but
not to disable it altogether. But it still seems to be possible
to disable blurring by a) switching to a theme with non-shitty
fonts, e.g., the W98-lookalike (Segui UI is shit), and b) setting
some FontSmoothing values in the registry to zero. (However, 
switching the theme resets them.)

Other than that, W7 seems clearly faster than Vista -- it's even
usable in VMWare after some initial disk crunching on my Athlon
XP 2500+ / 768MB. The sorry attempts at tiling by throwing the
window to the side of the screen seem like they could be quite
nice on a tablet, but clearly doesn't scale due to lack of tabbing.
The Ribbon UI actually seems like it could be quite nice if it
served as _documentation_, displaying the keys corresponding to
the buttons etc. when e.g. a modifier is pressed. But of course,
since Vista, Windows has _hidden_ all the keyboard shortcut 
(*beep* the term "shortcut" implies fundamentally flawed design)
by default; you've had to enable them fron the accessibility 
options in the control panel.

A simple player that lets me use the file system for organising 
my music, instead of reinventing the wheel and enforcing an
aoverbearing playlist system. (The ever so popular mpd sucks 
donkey balls.)

I've heard good words about foobar2000, though.

bc? What use is it? Try calc.

)

> Backup: rsnapshot

I've yet to find a backup tool that wouldn't suck. For *nix anyway.

Using duplicity ATM (to another local disk), because I had plans 
of a network backup. But it can't handle file moves sanely, i.e., 
just storing the action, not a new copy of the file. Brackup
seemed like it would be nice, being based on hashes, but it's
just broken. But *nix has got these inode numbers which would
really suffice...

I share your hate of glossy screens. It's been a few harsh years.

I happened to see a few matte-screen-laptops from Samsung recently,
maybe you can finally find one.
But then, it was quite a small-size (10 to 12") and probably
widescreen resolution.

I also heard you can find companies that replace MacBooks screens with
matte ones for $100.
FYI, the "matte screen" option is $100, only available on the biggest $2500 Mac.


Of course, you probably hate the Mac's UI and its lack of possible
customizations.
It certainly lacks configuration possibilities, but the multitouch
gestures make mac-WM less painful.
GeekBind did much about this, but does not work on the latest MacOS versions.
Maybe Nick has more MacOS WM-tricks, because I'm really new to Mac.


Good luck,

I suspect I'm just as new! The keyboard shortcuts for OS X do seem particularly difficult to remember (I have to look up screenshot and how to select the menu bar every time).

I only really use OS X as a casual OS; I can't manage without ion these days; floating wms just seem a pain in comparison.

Yeah, they only seem to sell matte displays on corporate-priced stuff
worth more than your monthly salary. To people who want quality and 
are ready to pay for it. The typical idiot consumer is all wet over 
a 19" (wow, big number!) dragtop with a glossy (shineee! my precious!)
finish.

Matte display finish is like green paint: worth more than the device
it is covered with. \end{army joke}

(In theory e.g. the el cheapo Thinkpad SL400 should be available in 
matte, but all the shops only seem to carry glossy versions.)

bibtex, metapost, xdvi, xpdf, gv, psbind -3 [*], dvipdfm.

And should we start listing latex packages too?


Seriously though, this listing of all the software one uses
and that is far removed from setting up a consistent "ionic" 
operating (no desktops here!) environment, could be seen as 
spamming the list. A wiki would be a better location for this
sort of stuff but, alas, it's too much of a hassle to set up
one that wouldn't start sucking. 

Maybe some site offers "ad hoc wikis", a bit akin to pastebots?


[*] With narrow text column classes such as amsart, three pages 
fit on one side of an A4 just fine with psbind, and saves a lot 
of paper -- together with duplex printing, of course.

Subject: Keyboard focus lost in Swing applications (ex: Netbeans) after
	changing to window
Message-ID: <87sknkgbd6.fsf@CPU107.opentrends.net>


Hi, sorry if this message comes twice (I posted yesterday via NNTP without being subscribed to the list).


  ion3 is stealing keyboard focus to Swing applications. This happens for instance with Netbeans 6.5:

1. Open netbeans and some other programs in tabs next to it.
2. Select netbeans and open an editor with some code; the cursor is inside the editor
3. Select another tab (either clicking teh tab or with keyboard).
4. Select netbeans again (either clicking the tab or with keyboard).
5. Try to continue typing, but you can't. The cursor is nowhere, and *no key* works (space, cursors, A-S-o, ... all gone). You must click again in the editor and then you can type again.

In fact any Swing application has this problem. You can use this one to test:

--- TypeInSwing.java ----------------------------------------

import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.JTextField;

public class TypeInSwing {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    JFrame frame = new JFrame("HelloWorldSwing");
    final JTextField field = new JTextField("type here");

    frame.getContentPane().add(field);

    frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    frame.pack();
    frame.setVisible(true);
  }
}

--------------------------------------------------------------

It happens with latest version 20090110 (with 20080207 too).

I am using:

$ java -version
java version "1.6.0_06"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_06-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 10.0-b22, mixed mode)


  Why is it so?


Daniel

Probably because Swing is crap and sets the focus somewhere where
it shouldn't be -- in violation of the ICCCM. X doesn't forward 
focus changes to the WM is requests, but rather obeys each and 
every one (unless the target window is hidden, etc.), so the 
WM should have to start fighting agianst them.

But the MacOS JVM sucks,
the Windows ecosystem makes Java not portable,
the "exotic platforms" Java Editions lacks the libraries (not portable again),
and Java for the web was stillborn, dead, resurrected and will keep
being a zombie.

"Java is pain" is enough.

Subject: Multi-, different- monitors is multi-hopeless?
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0901160131060.5209@acer.home.local>

I have a laptop with an LCD w/ 1280x800 resolution, and an external CRT 
that's either at 1024x768, 1280x960, or unavailable (depending on whether 
I'm at work, home, or somewhere else, respectively).


Here's what I've settled on in Enlightenment (E17): I have four "desktops" 
on each monitor. Alt+F1 through Alt+F4 jump to their respective desktops. 
Alt+F? on the LCD doesn't change the desktop on the CRT. Alt+F? on the CRT 
doesn't change the desktop on the LCD. They're independent. The 'xrandr' 
command allows me to switch the CRT to one of the three modes I need 
(work/home/off).

But, really, the only reason I've stayed with E17 so long is that it's the 
only window manager that handles multi-monitors the way I want it done. A 
lot of the choices behind Ion jive really well with what I actually want 
in a WM. (keyboard ?ber alles, window manager that actually *manages*, and 
Lua(yay!))


Based mostly on the latest "Shit-or-rama [Was: mod_xinerama]" thread [1], 
I'm not optimistic about Ion emulating this setup. But is it an accurate 
statement that there is no nice way to use ion3 such that I get:

1. per-monitor workspaces

2. ability to move windows between monitors

3. ability to switch CRT resolution/presence w/out restarting X

(...part of the difficulty being that my monitor heights don't match up)


If it's true that there's no "nice" way: does anyone have convoluted 
workarounds or horrible hacks that might require lots of setup (but 
minimal effort thereafter) that manage to achieve these goals?

As an example of "horrible/convoluted": several months ago, when I last 
went through a "This window manager sucks; I should try some new ones that 
support my monitors" phase, I was optimistic about "XMOVE: A pseudoserver 
for X window movement" [2]. Or maybe running a couple or several X VNC 
servers would work.  E.g. "left half" (LCD) = frame with Xvnc :0 and Xvnc 
:1, "right half" (CRT) = frame with Xvnc :2. Then "moving windows" 
becomes: "close vncviewer :1 on LCD, open it on CRT".


And, if it's true that there's not even a horrible way to get all three, 
what are the various X settings that I need to enable/disable to get 2/3 
of the desired properties (Looks easiest to sacrifice "ability to move 
windows between monitors")?

Obviously: disable XRandR and Xinerama. (Problem there: I can't seem to 
find the correct incantation to disable Xinerama. I'm planning to just 
recompile X without it.
...Though another workaround (rename Xiner SHIToR /usr/lib/libXiner* ) is 
slightly more amusing.)

and in xorg.conf, I'd need:

three "Monitor" sections: 1 for LCD, 1 for home CRT, 1 for work CRT
three "Screen" sections: 1 for 1280x800, 1 for 1280x960, 1 for 1024x768
three "ServerLayout" sections: 1 for LCD+home, 1 for LCD+work, 1 for LCD-only

Sound right?

Thanks for any help. I really like everything I've seen in Ion so far, 
except for this multi-monitor business. (And I realize it's not Ion that's 
to blame.)

Best,
Ben

I use mod_xinerama, xrandr, and lua script that changes ion's session
string via ioncore.set_paths(). This suffices, as I need to restart ion3
(but not X nor applications) every time I switch xrandr configuration.
This way I have one saved layout for each xrandr configuration I tried.

Also I created lua binding to attach a client to _root_ window ->
"both screens full screen". I use global variable to remember which
frame was the client attached to, thus the function is able to put the
client to "normal" state again.

Note that I use patched mod_xinerama, because original mod_xinerama
doesn't allow ion3 to shutdown/restart properly. The one line change was
posted to the list by someone already.

Works perfectly here on my workstation, but tuomov will not help you in any
way, when you use it. If you have a problem: remove the module and
reproduce it.

These two points work perfectly. ion3+mod_xinerama, e17 and awesome are the
only windowmanagers, I know with this feature.

Should work with xrandr, never tried it, but you need to restart ion3 in
any way.

Argh. I'm an idiot. I assumed since mod_xrandr was loaded that 
mod_xinerama had been loaded, too. This is working well for me, too, now.

Yep, in the same "shit-or-rama" thread I mentioned.

BTW, Tobias Hommel: I'm using your ebuild from a few days ago, and it 
doesn't seem to have that patch. (It has mod_xinerama-20080902 rather than

I happened to be awake when the 50% off lenovo x61s coupon code was
posted and got one with docking station + overpriced dvd burner and
4-year warranty for about $1100 incl tax, much lower than when I
bought almost an identical x61s about 18 months previous.  That said,
it's kinda sad that the only reason it could be considered
'affordable' is that Lenovo was blowing them out so that they can
hurry up and end-of-life them (I guess?).

Firefox makes me die a little inside each time I interact with it.  I
fucking hate it, and it's all the worse because I noticed the suck
back between the 1.0 -> 1.5 transition, and it's only gotten worse.
Maybe I'll give opera another shot sometime.  Looking forward to
chrome on linux.

I'd really need for remind to keep working for me is a better backup

One thing I've been wondering is, whether a widescreen display on
a laptop (not a dragtop!) is actually a bad idea too. And it's the
trend. For most _sane_ documents, the height of the screen is more
important than width. (The Modern Web counts as sheer lunacy. In
a few years, given the trend, it will require triple-widescreen 
configurations for all the advertisements and other crap, yet still
have a single 5cm text column in the middle.)

You'd need at least 15.4" WS (1.6 aspect) to fit a single A5-sized 
document (21cm tall) on the screen without noticeable downscaling. 
Such a laptop is already quite huge width-wise. In 4:3 aspect ratio
14" is enough, and width-wise it's about the same as 13.1" WS, which
just about fits a keyboard without it looking crammed. (I don't 
have much direct experience with laptops.) And a 12" 4:3 is 
approximately as tall as a 14.1" WS.

(A5 is what you get when you print two pages on one A4 sheet, and
anything noticeably smaller than that is too small for documents
that you have not specifically prepared for printing small --
see earlier post. In fact, an approx A4 sized screen -- A4 has
14.5" diameter -- with sqrt(2)/1=~1.4 aspect ratio, which is wider 
than  4:3=~1.3 but taller than 1.6, could be quite nice on a laptop.
The WS laptopss themselves actually have about the aspect ratio of A4,
but tend to have huge uneven borders around the screen.

I've heard of it before and on principle it seemed almost what I've
wanted. However, at least then it suffered from some limitations that
I can't recall now, so I didn't bother trying it. 
I also read mail on a remote computer that I don't control, so
installing programs written in one of the Popular Bloated Scripting
Languages isn't very straightforward.

That sounds bad.

I use a combination of xmessages and the cell phone for reminders,
depending on the importance of the reminder and whether I should
be near a computer anyway to act on it. (Why can't computer calendar
software be as simple as that in cell phones? Wait! Probably they've
managed to ruin them in them too with increased screen size and CPU 
power.)

That is completely true. WS and X-black-shiny-crap have been forced
upon us, nobody sane would like that, and we're pretty much fucked up.
But maybe some guy will get it right someday.

The Web will not require a triple-wide screen since the trend seems
precisely to get the content on a third of the width, two thirds being
empty white (or styled) borders. And, preferably, long pages and large
headers, so it's frequent not to be able to even read half of the
latest post without scrolling. Just have a look at Blogger, Wordpress
and DotClear default and most used themes.

Yes, the Web has the exact inverse trend than the screens. I am still
wondering about that too. Who can tell what crap the
Web-for-phones-and-devices will give us next ?

> In fact, an approx A4 sized screen [...] could be quite nice on a laptop.

That would be great, readable, and not to mention easier to fit in normal bags.

The two thirds are mega-wide and force the text out of view in narrow
browsers for sane content (such as my slightly smaller than portrait A4
or "letter" window on a 17" 4:3 display) and viewing other stuff on the
side. You need the tripe-wide screen configuration to not have
to scroll horizontally to get to the text.

Of course, it would also be great if you could use it as a tablet in
portrait mode... with an e-paper display mode. The current "tablet PCs"
seem horribly kludgy, though, and, in fact, it might be better for the
tablet mode to be the default, with the computer behind the screen and
no keyboard except on a docking station that perhaps can be attached
to the computer nicely for transportation. At least I don't think 
I'd miss the keyboard much when travelling lightly. The keyboard 
does work as a screen cover, though, and there needs to be something
to replace that function. Surely it can be made lighter and less 
fragile than esp. tablet hinges. Or maybe the docking station can
be made to fill this function, essentially making the computer
of two detachable parts, so the tablet can be made less clunky.

In fact, maybe you could also split the eletronics and battery
between the two components, further reducing the tablet weight.
E.g., a primary storage HD (or SSD) could go in the KB part, as 
well as any optical drives -- actually, it sucks that you have to 
again pay extra for a laptop that doesn't waste space for one;
this is again something that belongs in a docking station or
otherwise external device -- with a smaller SSD on the tablet
part for the OS and some documents etc. The mechanical coupling
between the parts of course has to be made reliable.

I don't use mod_xrandr, for me it is useless since it doesn't support
xrandr 1.2. I'm thinking about writing new mod_xrandr (a replace for
old mod_xrandr and mod_xinerama), which can also read or write display
proprerties. (This way I can control backlight on my laptop.) Also, the
module should be more scriptable, providing xrandr functions to lua.

Xrandr 1.2 itself is useless shit-o-rama shit. *nix is dead.

Sorry for useless spamming the list. But for me xrandr just sucks, but
it is useful. WIMP sucks more, thus I use ION and *nix. If there will
be ion-like (pseudo)windowmanager for windows, I will use windows more.
And using more than one screen is very convenient for my work. Most of
the time I use laptop screen in vertical position to show compiled tex
page and desktop lcd to show editor of tex source and sources of my
work.

Sometimes I use Xrandr to set up beamer, so that I can present my
slides with notes for the speaker on screen of the laptop. And when
administrating a cluster of servers I use cssh, to do same things on all
servers at once. Then I'm glad for any space for my terminals. There is
currently no option to multiple screens than xrandr today.

Yes there is: it's called plain-old-X-multihead, or _the clean
solution_ that doesn't smell of a rotten kludge to the other side
of the globe. *Eugh*, adding more screens by pre-allocating a huge
root window and then adding views to it, *eugh*, *puke*, *blaargh*.
And that's the approach taken to everything these days in 
Futile/fascist Open Sore Software. (Futile, because it's destined
to become just another incredibly poor bastard son of Windows and
MacOS, instead of offering a real choice. Fascist, because it
offers no practical choice anymore; only the _purely theoretical_
choice of forking the code yourself, wasting your life on it.)

How about just creating new root windows dynamically? And using 
the same old APIs that are used for any other windows?

Hi,
  I tried it with Sun's Java 1.6.0_10 on Debian (another machine). The bug is still present.
  However, on the same machine, Sun's Java 1.5.0_16-b02 makes my example work as expected (focus is not lost).

  And with libgcj... well, the example didn't work correctly and I didn't see the text field. My version:
java version "1.5.0"
gij (GNU libgcj) version 4.3.3 20090110 (prerelease)

  With OpenJDK 1.6.0_0-b11, the bug shows up.
  With the unreleased Java 1.7.0-ea-b43, the same (bug present).

  So the focus problem seems to be a regression introduced in version 1.6 of Java and still not corrected...
  Or maybe it is indeed a bug in ion3; since other window managers (ex: icewm) do work with Java 1.6.

  In any case, I sent this bug to Java (sorry, it's not public yet). I will report progress here.

It seems that at most it could be related to different interpretations
of the ICCCM that's a bit vague at this point, race conditions, etc.

One possible problem is the handling of the WM_TAKE_FOCUS call, 
although most "modern" toolkits just seem to ignore X focus
for any widgets, and do their own complicated buggy focus tracking,
(cause of the legendary firefox/gtk focus bug that took years to fix,
and only by an Ion user, not the gtk lamers) so WM_TAKE_FOCUS should
pretty much be ignored.

Try moving the region_finalise_focusing call to the beginning of
clientwin_do_set_focus. This could help -- and seems to be the more
logical order of the calls -- but it will probably break some other
applications. The ICCCM doesn't seem to specify in which order the
WM should set the focus to the application top level window, and
send the WM_TAKE_FOCUS message that tells the client to give the
focus to a more specific widget. Also, since there's no (simple) 
way to coordinate the timestamp of the actual focus change call
with Xlib, and the timestamp for the client message has to be 
obtained by a hack, this could cause problems. 

Probably it won't help, and will break other things, but it
seems worth a try.
