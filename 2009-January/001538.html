Probably because Swing is crap and sets the focus somewhere where
it shouldn't be -- in violation of the ICCCM. X doesn't forward 
focus changes to the WM is requests, but rather obeys each and 
every one (unless the target window is hidden, etc.), so the 
WM should have to start fighting agianst them.

In 1995, Linux was almost a bicycle; an alternative way of live to the
Windows petrol beasts that had to be taken to the dealer for service.
By 2008, Linux has bloated into a gas-guzzler, and the cycle paths 
have been replaced with polluted motorways.
