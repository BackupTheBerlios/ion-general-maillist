It really depends on whether the learning effort is comparable
the effort the skill saves later on. If you use the program a lot, 
such as WM or an editor for many in the present audience, clearly 
learning the tool isn't really that much of an effort compared to how
much you are going to use the skill. But when you have to read a book
(or two) to disable font blurring, something very basic that you should 
only have to once on each computer (or ever!), the learning effort is 
far too high compared to the use-once-and-forget demand of the skill.

More like stevejobsy. Only Mac is as much against user choice as Gnome.

joe &lt;joe-editor.sf.net&gt; was easy for me to learn when I started with Linux
in 1995 or so, thanks to the ^K H help screen that stays open while you
edit. It still does most I need from an editor, and still use it for all 
my editing needs. (Used to use jed for a couple of years, with joe-like
bindings, but its development has stalled with many remaining problems.
Then joe got syntax HL and jed didn't offer anything I really needed.
Language-specific auto-indentation is mostly just in the way.)
