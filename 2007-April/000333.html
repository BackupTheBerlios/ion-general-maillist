*nod* I read the other thread quite recently. It's Tuomo's project so
it's fair for him to say what he will and won't do with it.

Indeed. If I had more time I'd probably work on one myself. Although I
couldn't care less about anti-aliasing -- one of the things I like about
ion is how small the title bars are. I've never been keen on the amount
of space that Gnome/KDE/Windows/etc waste on them.

</I>&gt;<i> GIMP/Photoshop is a matter of personal preference (and money), but
</I>&gt;<i> using Gimp under ion3 is really fantastic. That's also a matter of
</I>&gt;<i> presonal preference but I think :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - combinating GIMP's shortcuts if you know/like them, and ion's

</I>&gt;<i> - using winprops to position this annoying GIMP tool preferences away
</I>&gt;<i> from your drawing frame is cool
</I>&gt;<i> - switching from windowed to fullscreen mode is easy
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which in the end makes your mouse used only for the graphic art stuff
</I>&gt;<i> and eliminates useless and time-eating movements back and forth the
</I>&gt;<i> applications' options. Priceless :)
</I>
*nod* I should figure out winprops at some point since at the moment I
have to gimp in a floating workspace, and I don't like floating windows :)
