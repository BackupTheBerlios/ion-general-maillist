<PRE>I'm unlikely to yet go for the devious little hack featured in the
earlier post, but I've tried clarifying and simplifying the license
a bit (attachment), because people seem to be too illiterate to
understand the original. As a side effect it would, however, be turned
into a form suitable for use with the devious little hack by just one
simple removal (and even more if using GPLv3). Also it can be easily
be modified to not even be based on LGPL for a yet simpler license
(also attached).

Questions, comments?

*** DRAFT ***

Copyright (c) Tuomo Valkonen 1999-2007.

Unless otherwise indicated in components taken from elsewhere, this software
is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 (&quot;LGPL&quot;,
reproduced below), extended and modified with the following terms:

  If the name Ion(tm) or other names that can be associated with the Ion
  project are used to distribute this software, then:

    - A version that does not significantly differ from one of the
      copyright holder's releases, must be provided by default.

    - Versions not based on the copyright holder's latest release (on 
      the corresponding &quot;branch&quot;, such as Ion3(tm)), must within 28 days
      of this release, be prominently marked as (potentially) obsolete
      and unsupported.

    - Significantly altered versions may be provided only if the user
      explicitly requests for those modifications to be applied, and 
      is prominently notified that the software is no longer considered 
      the standard version, and is not supported by the copyright holder.
      The version string displayed by the program must describe these
      modifications and the &quot;support void&quot; status.

  Versions for which the above conditions are not satisfied, must be
  renamed so that they can not be associated with the Ion project, their
  executables must be given names that do not conflict with the copyright
  holder's version, and neither the copyright holder nor the Ion project
  may be referred to for support.

  In the text of sections 0-2, 4-12, and 14-16 of the LGPL, &quot;this License&quot; 
  is to be understood to refer to the LGPL extended with these terms and,
  where applicable, possible similar terms related to the names of other
  works forming a whole. Sections 3 and 13 of the LGPL are void. Where
  contradictory, these additional terms are primary to the LGPL.

End of terms.


Explanations

Trademarks: With the terms above primarily appealing to copyright law,
should any of the indicated trademarks be found invalid, does not excuse
you from the conditions imposed by those terms. The use of these names
in contexts other than redistribution of this software and modifications,
is outside the scope of the terms above, and governed by applicable
trademark or other laws. 

  With regard to modules and other extensions to Ion(tm), the permission
  is hereby granted to use &quot;Ion&quot; as part of the name, provided that it
  occurs in a form suggesting that the work is supported by neither the
  copyright nor the Ion project: &quot;Foo for Ion&quot; instead of &quot;Ion Foo&quot;, etc.

Significant change: Bug fixes are a priori insignificant as additions. 
Basic changes that are needed to install or run the software on a target
platform are a priori insignificant. Additionally, basic configuration
changes to better integrate the software with the target platform, 
without obstructing the standard behaviour, are a priori insignificant.
Everything else is significant. The copyright holder reserves the right 
to refine the definition of significant changes on a per-case basis. 
Please consult when in doubt. 

Distributions: For example, suppose an aggregate distribution of software
provides an `installpkg` command for installing packages. Then the action
`installpkg ion3` (resp. `installpkg ion`) should after 28 days provide the
latest release of Ion3 (resp. the latest stable release), or prominently 
notify the user that the provided version is (likely to be) obsolete and
unsupported. Specific versions (including modified versions) may be provided
if the user explicitly requests for those, within the constraints set above.
The latest release being provided by default, or prominently appearing in
a listing, constitutes prominent marking of earlier releases as obsolete.

The intent of these terms is to curb the power that &quot;distributions&quot;, as
the primary sources of software for many users, have in defining what
is perceived as Ion. By providing significantly modified versions and
out-dated development snapshots without prominently mentioning this fact,
they do not present the work in a light that the author can agree with,
and create a burden of dealing with (new) users seeking for support for
such versions.

Unless otherwise indicated in components taken from elsewhere, it is
permitted to redistribute this software, in both source code and binary
forms, provided that the following conditions are met:

  If the name Ion(tm) or other names that can be associated with the Ion

  You must keep intact this license and all the notices referring to it,
  and distribute a copy of this license along with the documentation or
  other materials provided with the distribution.

  The copyright holder and the Ion project are granted similar rights to
  your modifications, as this license grants you. This requirement does 
  not apply to independent works merely using this software as an easily
  replaceable component.

No restrictions are placed on the use this software, apart from acts of
redistribution.


THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER ``AS IS'' AND FREE OF

HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF
SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
