&gt;<i>First, thanks for starting this thread! I did notice that Tuomov's pages
</I>&gt;<i>were down, but since his whole site was down, I was waiting for it to
</I>&gt;<i>come back without realizing he might have taken the whole project down.
</I>&gt;<i>Quick question: do we know for sure Tuomov has severed connections with
</I>&gt;<i>ion3 permanently or is this our best guess at this point?
</I>
While I have great appreciation for Tuomo's work, I don't think
the answer to this question matters to me personally. I am hoping
this fork will succeed because I want to pursue functionality
that has so far been blocked (xinerama, xrandr, xft,
iconization, EWMH, built-in support for idiosynchratic
applications, etc).

&gt;<i>ion3 has been my primary environment for a while now, and I won't
</I>&gt;<i>consider changing. I love its design, philosophy, and simplicity, but
</I>&gt;<i>I'm preaching to the choir here.
</I>
:<i>-)
</I>
&gt;<i>I'm all for forking into /one/ fork, and that too only because of the
</I>&gt;<i>licensing issue--please lets not make multiple messy forks. Like a few
</I>&gt;<i>of you, I don't have much time either right now, but expect to be able
</I>&gt;<i>to contribute a more a few months down the line. But I can contribute
</I>&gt;<i>towards getting us going right now if needed.
</I>
This is the same position I am in.

&gt;<i>We have at least a few tasks to accomplish ASAP just so we don't lose
</I>&gt;<i>continuity or momentum (please suggest other things that need to be done
</I>&gt;<i>too):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>- We need a new name and so far, I personally like both &quot;notion&quot; (my top
</I>&gt;<i>  favorite) and &quot;neon&quot;. Do we have any other nominations? Note that we
</I>&gt;<i>  can always change the name later. It's good to get moving on things
</I>&gt;<i>  even based on a temporary name if we can't reach consensus.
</I>
I've liked a number of suggestions, including particleman, but
notion remains my first choice.

&gt;<i>- We need to get the codebase including the latest set of sources (easy,
</I>&gt;<i>  many of us have this), and also as much of the associated git repos as
</I>&gt;<i>  we can.
</I>
I think we should put the current source as-is in a repo, then do
a massive s/ion3/newname/ and modify the top-level documentation
to mention our debt to Tuomo and the heritage of the project,
while pointing users away from Tuomo and to a new bug tracker and
mailing list.

In other words I think the pristine source should be the first
commit to the repo, so even the initial modifications (including
the name change) are recorded.

We should plan to make a first release within a couple months,
containing the simple combination of renamed-ion3 with the
existing out-of-tree modules we collect. Releasing early before
going into more serious development should help us gain momentum
quickly.

&gt;<i>- We need a central place to get ourselves organized and store code. I
</I>&gt;<i>  nominate sourceforge (well established, well known, supports git).
</I>&gt;<i>  I've speculatively created a new 'notion' project (we can change name,
</I>&gt;<i>  details, or even the site later):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://notion.sourceforge.net/">http://notion.sourceforge.net/</A>
</I>
Looks good, thanks!

&gt;<i>- We need 2 or 3 managers and/or lead devlopers. IMHO, managers do not
</I>&gt;<i>  /necessarily/ need to have in-depth code knowledge, and lead
</I>&gt;<i>  developers do not need to necessarily manage, though this can all be
</I>&gt;<i>  the same person. Any volunteers?
</I>
I will be happy to contribute on both fronts after a couple
weeks. Right now I'm in crunch mode toward releasing a product at
work so I won't be able to immediately commit any substantial
time toward notion.

Regards,
Aron
