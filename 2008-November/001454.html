<PRE>What--and I am serious--about rewriting Ion in ... Haskell?

(Haskell ... just in case: I have entertained myself in Miranda and Hope a
bit already, but those are not *free*; plus, while not looking like cpan.org,
hackage.haskell.org is not ... nothing; seems also to me that the Haskell
community is growing in size -- hooray.)

Why so?!, because Ion is written--shudder--in the US-dollar of the programming
languages anno 2008 still; hence, Tuomo (but not only he) has, to ... I am
paraphrasing Torvalds, play at the &quot;masturbating monke^H^H^H^H^Hreindeer&quot;
every time he needs to change something in the code that goes beyond
cosmetics, and be it as as an experiment only, quite likely. ( C's
*expressivity* oblige.)

I skip mentioning other advantages in general, moreover I am sure Tuomo
perfectly knows that Compiled Haskell is as fast than C, and that there is a
Haskell Lua interpreter. (Haskell -&gt; Riot ... which I never have tried by the
way.)

Yes, there is at least another window manager which is written in Haskell,
XMonad (which seems also interesting), so what?! Does taking good or better
decisions/options mean that others have to stick within the crap?

Ion's development is managed in a way that the *popularity* of a language
doesn't matter too much, as long the source can be easily compiled.

Lua may be fun, but Haskell (and other modern functional languages) are no
match ... on standard environments at the least. And as a neophyte I would
be much more interested in learning Haskell than Lua anyway. (To let us
understand further: XMonad should use configuration files written in Haskell.)

dwm and all its clone and derivatives look like nano (the editor), or pico of
the window managers pretty much to me, where ion could be vi; I never (but I
am going to change that) have tried xmonad. Who knows, it might be nice to
write a vim, or better, an elvis of the window managers ...

Haskell alone would not bring us much far by itself. But Tuomo should
have got some nice insight and original ideas in the topic--usable window
managers--meanwhile ... does he?
