&gt;<i> It seems to be me, that the distros' and the FOSS herd's attitude
</I>&gt;<i> is uncorrectable. And their present attitude is incompatible with
</I>&gt;<i> me.
</I>
And it looks to me as Tuomo is being vindicated :)

Kidding aside, it goes beyond the &quot;FOSS herd's attitude.&quot;

Shall I, more generally, recommend reading the book--among those fundamentals
ones to have opened once in life--and classic, How to Solve It, by George
Polya?

If you are keen to improve your problem solving skills, and don't know the
book yet, this is a HIGHLY suggested reading.

George Polya has been a professor in Mathematics but don't fear.

Similarly to Karl Marx, who [correctly, eventually ... and in a sense--Marx
was humorously exaggerating a bit of course] has remarked that even a child
would be able to understand and follow the logic of his *Das Kapital*, a work,
nota bene, among the most important achievements of humanity [Louis Althusser:
das Kapital has opened to mankind the *continent* of the SCIENTIFIC study of
history and related disciplines nothing less], George Polya could have stated
that no other mathematical knowledge beyond an elementary one is required to
understand How to Solve It. (Well, maybe Polya has said that too.)

In short, the book, How to Solve It, is focused on understanding problems,
devising and carrying out plans, checking the answers. And the strategies
practiced in it could even help you in--example--ordering pizza in New York,
eventually. (Ordering pizza more effectively, I mean.)

Anyway: please, please, PLEASE ... Tuomo, stick with system.mk!

Cheers,

/Roy Lanek
