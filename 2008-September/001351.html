In a *proper* bookshop, you can try before you buy. You scan through the
isles, find something interesting, can read the blurb, can scan through
the pages, even read a few, to see if you might like it. Likewise you can
download freeware and shareware to try before you buy, although it's a
bit more cumbersome than scanning through a book in a *proper* bookshop.
*Alas*, there's only one bookshop worth anything anymore in .fi, and it's
(of course) 300km from where I live. Most of the so-called bookshops just 
sell sudoku sheets, biographies, Harry Potter, Dan Brown and stuff like 
that. So, alas, one is stuck to online bookshops (primarily amazon.co.uk, 
because the more local ones run by the dying brick&amp;mortar bookshops are
comparably expensive and slow^1) where one can't try before one buys. 
So one rather trusts external reviews and previous experience with a
particular author, and only seldom buys something previously unknown.

Anyway, choosing software by ratings on a site is like buying blindly 
from an online bookshops as opposed to a proper bookshop.

(Some say that deregulation killed the bookshop; when the big box
hypermarkets were allowed to sell books -- only mainstream crap, of
course -- the masses started buying that mainstream crap from there, and
the bookshops no longer could support sales and display of more marginal
with larger sales of mainstream products.)

(^1 And I'm not talking about super-fast courier services, just plain 
old snailmail, because I prefer picking up the package from the post 
office when it suits me to having to wait for a courier. The more
local shops don't seem to have their own stock, instead ordering 
everything from the publisher, and this takes time.)

&gt;<i> Uuuh, slashdot is even on the [proxy] list of my forbidden URLs, 
</I>
I also put in junkbuster (how approriate!) at some point, but later
I've learned to mostly just stay away from time-waster sites full 
of idiots.
