I do not quite understand (or not at all?): even if one can in principle
use the function call based configuration to do 'arbitrary' things, as it
stands, it seems not illegitimate for a user to read the files in ~/.ion3 as
&quot;static config-files with a strange syntax&quot;. my point is simply that at least
for a start it does not harm to approach it in that way and tell the new user:
&quot;if you want to change shortcut x, modify the corresponding line in file y&quot;.
so what exactly do you mean by 'not doable reliably'? could it not at least 
be done in a &quot;justifable&quot; way?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, if someone wants to provide an alternative configuration system

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree: scratchpad as the sole location is no good for this. but why not make

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you want to improve the man page?
</I>I have no real issue with the manpage in its present form, although it is
_very_ terse and probably not that helpful for first time users (afterwards
it serves as a memo for forgotten keyboard shortcuts). I thought the
discussion related to where one should put additional documentation/tutorial
stuff. but of course one could put that in the manpage as well (the 'bash
approach'). I'm not sure whether that's the best way.
