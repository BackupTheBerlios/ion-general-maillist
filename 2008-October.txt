Subject: unfocused floating windows
Message-ID: <11ccdb80f16.vulk.stell@tin.it>

Hi,
I'm running ion-3-20081002 on my tablet and I would like to use one 
of those programs that emulate a keyboard end recognize the 
handwriting. Cellwriter (http://risujin.org/cellwriter/) looks like the 
kind of program I'd like. There is a problem: once the text has been 
recognized I must press a button to send it to the focused window and 
of course with the sloppy focus model the windows is never the one I'd 
like to but cellwriter's one.
My question is, is it possible to force a 
window not to have focus even if the pointer is on it (something 
similar to what happens to the rest of the windows when the scratchpad 
is visible)?
If so is it a winprop?

ioncore.set{mousefocus='disabled'} will disable pointer-based 
focusing entirely. Restore with 'sloppy'. Currently there are
no other options, as nobody's been arsed to write them.
Also, it's possible to make floating windows 'passive'
(setting passive = true in WMPlex.attach[_new] parameters),
but there's no winprop hack for it; using it would demand
some custom scripting.

  I have been using the function you sent and it works very well; thanks.
  With Tuomo's improvements, I think it would be very helpful for the scratchpad feature of Ion. Could it be included?

Message-ID: <92ad778c0810071108l6ee6c8e2yecddee913b69511b@mail.gmail.com>

I seem to be stuck in a position where I can't move a transient window.

I have my pidgin (.im) buddy list nice and narrow on the right of my
screen. When someone wants to add themselves as a buddy of mine a
transient window pops up but half of it is hidden and when I move the
buddy list to another (bigger) frame the transient doesn't move with
it.

when I right click on the transient all I see is "Close, Attach
Tagged, Clear Tags, Window Info" resizing the frame the transient is
in doesn't help either.

I've put up a screenshot at http://wtwf.com/tmp/pidgin.png

is there an easy way for me to get this transient window moved around?

the easiest solution would be starting pidgin on a floating workspace.
On the other hand you could switch to a bitlbee+irssi combination. ;-)

How is the window hidden? Is it clearly inside the frame of the main
window, or could it be just partially outside the screen?

These days Ion automatically detaches (or "unsqueezes") big transients
that don't properly fit in the frame, and they don't follow their main
windows around. You can disable this behaviour with

    ioncore.set{ unsqueeze = false }

yes it's outside of the screen, perhaps hidden isn't the right description.
I think the secret I'm looking for is the Meta+LeftMouseButton moves
floating windows. tip. I'll give that a shot next time this issue
comes up.

thanks for the replies! it's been a big help.

I love the new ion maximize behavior, just makes me smile to see even 
the status bar go away when I use it.

I've been trying to figure out where the problem is with maximizing any 
of the flash video players out there, google, youtube, etc to the frame 
they're in. They all try and then return to the normal embedded player 
mode. Does anyone have any input into that?

They're crap that try to be their own WMs. Flash in particular
doesn't think it should be in FS mode if it doesn't have the
focus.

Flash has many defects, but is this one so bad ?

I wouldn't like the ugly Flash ads on a web-page to make itself
fullscreen without asking,
nor would I like the warning "hit escape to quit fullscreen" screen to
be disable-able.

Flash is made for dummies. I mean, *real* dummies.
Some of their limitations are features, not bugs or omissions.

It is. Most importantly, there's a race condition: if the flash 
window doesn't get the focus fast enough, when it goes into FS 
mode, it will close. But this "trying to outsmart the WM" also
means you can't open the scratchpad while flash is FS, can't
switch back to another WS while flash is FS, or the window will
un-FS.

This "feature" won't stop that, if the flash crap can avoid the
above-mentioned race condition.

> Flash is made for dummies.

All Web technology invented after HTML 2.0, with the exception
of CSS, is for dummies. 

(And even CSS is too complicated.  I suspect it could be 
simplified a lot, if would only have to cater to document 
layout, not application layout. And applications would benefit
from something not suited to documents. *sigh* again trying
to do everything with one language.)

Just stating where things seem to be going.

There's a problem? It should not be set, and there's a school of
thought that thinks this is how it should be. I have no particular
opinion (!) about the matter, but tend to slightly side with not
setting it. I just wish MUAs were more intelligent about List-Post
and headers. Even mutt -- the mail user agent that sucks the least
-- is stupid with regard to mailing lists. It sucks having to
configure the lists in .procmailrc, include a subscribe line in
.muttrc, include a mailbox line in .muttrc for checking for new
mail (or alternatively, if not procmailed into separate folders, 
write save-hooks), and then remember to press L instead of r
to reply. The default reply key should ask what to do when there
are multiple options (list, group, or just the poster, etc.).
Setting Reply-To is a workaround to retarded MUAs. 

I just use slrn and nntp://news.gmane.org whenever possible.

So this is generally a flash problem with focus, very interesting, 
thanks for the insight.
Obviously letting anything actually have focus control is uncool so 
that's a problem.

Subject: OpenOffice focus
Message-ID: <20081013164621.GA11730@ATAC.rmtc.fedex.com>

I have a tiled workspace with a WFrame named 'Aux' and the following
'Aux' kludges:

defwinprop{
   class = "OpenOffice.org 2.4",
   target = "Aux",
}

defwinprop{
   class = "Acroread",
   instance = "acroread",
   acrobatic = true,
   target = "Aux",
}

Both Acrobat and OpenOffice open in the 'Aux' frame as desired,
but starting OpenOffice moves focus to the 'Aux' frame.  Acrobat
does not change the focus.  Changing switchto from true to false
doesn't seem to change this behavior.

Is there a way to configure ion so that OpenOffice leaves the focus
alone the way Acrobat does?

It is possible that OO is crap [of course it is, and utter and total
at that] and forces the focus, in violation of the ICCCM [1]. Focus 
change is not a request, but a command that the X server follows. 
ICCCM establishes protocols on when it may be used.

Subject: Manipulate floating splits or the scratchpad on the fly
Message-ID: <14989d6e0810300613m649b8f26qd2b640ba4e771f5f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I use ion as my WM of choice, at home as well as at work. I use a
couple of workspaces, every one configured to perform a certain task,
or make this task easier.
One of these workspaces contains Xnest with a Citrix client running
Lotus Notes (Citrix is by far the whorst App to run on any Unix host
since it behaves like a window manager in every regard except for
displaying icons of its iconified windows).
Anyway, I'm using the scratchpad rather often on this workspace, it's
a tool that comes in handy when I receive a mail to create a new user,
for example. Open scratchpad, enter the commands in the terminal
contained in it, and everything is done without ever moving a window
or switching a workspace.
But: The location or the geometry of the scratchpad often hides some
information I need, so I found myself changing its size regularly. So
recently I tried floating splits instead of the scratchpad. It's not
that bad, but I need to use the mouse to move it around. And I
remembered how much I hate moving anything around the screen...
So, I would like to have some commands to manipulate either the
scratchpad or a floating split:
- making it (dis)appear
- resize and reposition it (to be a column on the right side of the
screen, or a row taking all screen width on the bottom half of the
screen, or even resizining it to scatchpads default size).

Thing is: I've no idea how to do this, and hope for your help.
Yes, I did take a look at lua, so I'm afraid to do some coding. I just
don't know what ion3 resources I need.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, as well as any configuration
that I could use as an example.

It won't work on a non-tiled workspace?

Let us consider the scratchpad first: You need to request a new geometry 
for the object. To do so, you probably first want to find bounds for 
the geometry. For the present setting, the width and height of the
parent region is good enough a bound. To get the parent region, you
use WRegion.parent. And to get its geometry, WRegion.geom. Then you
calculate the new geometry within the parent region, and use 
WRegion.rqgeom on the scratchpad frame.

The mechanism for floating splits is similar, and the above might just
work, but you may instead want rqgeom on the floating split object.
If you want to do a detailed search for the split object, you can use
WTiling.node_of and WSplit.parent and obj_is testing or something.
Or you can use WTiling.split_tree and scan towards the leaves.

But such scanning may not be necessary. It may just suffice
to get WTiling.split_tree, check that it's a WSplitSplit (or
WSplitFloat), and use WSplitWSplit.current() as the node to
be resized.

If you're in a WTiling binding callback, _ is the tiling, and
_sub the frame. If you're in a WFrame binding callback, _
is the frame, and to get the tiling, you use _:manager().

Hopefully that helps. Ask more if it doesn't.

... design shit like EWMH, that is very closely tied to WIMPshit
desktop metaphor.

In any case, the ICCCM is very clear here
<http://www.tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/sec-4.html#s-4.1.7>:

"""
There are four models of input handling:

   * No Input - The client never expects keyboard input. An example would be
     xload or another output-only client.
"""

The ones that normal applications should adhere to are:

"""
   * Passive Input - The client expects keyboard input but never explicitly
sets
     the input focus. An example would be a simple client with no  
subwindows,
     which will accept input in PointerRoot mode or when the window manager
sets
     the input focus to its top-level window (in click-to-type mode).

   * Locally Active Input - The client expects keyboard input and explicitly
sets
     the input focus, but it only does so when one of its windows already
has the
     focus. An example would be a client with subwindows defining various
data
     entry fields that uses Next and Prev keys to move the input focus
between
     the fields. It does so when its top-level window has acquired the focus
in
     PointerRoot mode or when the window manager sets the input focus to its
     top-level window (in click-to-type mode).
"""

There is also

"""
   * Globally Active Input - The client expects keyboard input and  
explicitly
     sets the input focus, even when it is in windows the client does not
own. An
     example would be a client with a scroll bar that wants to allow users  
to
     scroll the window without disturbing the input focus even if it is in
some
     other window. It wants to acquire the input focus when the user clicks
in
     the scrolled region but not when the user clicks in the scroll bar
itself.
     Thus, it wants to prevent the window manager from setting the input
focus to
     any of its windows.
""""

But

"""
Clients using the Globally Active model can only use a SetInputFocus
request
to acquire the input focus when they do not already have it on receipt of
one of the following events:
   * ButtonPress
   * ButtonRelease
   * Passive-grabbed KeyPress
   * Passive-grabbed KeyRelease
"""

So you see, the cases when an application is allowed to set the focus
are clear and very limited.

Subject: Moving tabbar to bottom of the screen
Message-ID: <2e53f4ef0810310721g5e4dfc6kf6af8e3a9d348362@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
  I did not found in the docs neither in the archives, so I coming to you
guys.

  Is there a way for me to place the tab below the frame, instead of on top
of it?

Other than writing a patch, no.

It shouldn't be too difficult. There's already the 'bar' parameter
of frame styles, that supports the modes "inside", "outside", and
"shaped". Just add "-below" variants, and wherever FRAME_BAR_* 
is referred to, add extra cases for the below geometry.
